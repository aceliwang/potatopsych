# Somatoform Disorders

As a whole, this category of conditions involves physical symptoms without an organic or psychiatric cause excluding malingering, factitious disorder. 

Essentially, psychological distress manifests as physical symptoms. Differentials for somatisation include:
- Medically unexplained symptoms: symptoms without medical disorder or psychological distress
- Somatic presentations of psychiatric disorders: symptoms with a psychiatric disorder
- Somataform disorders: symptoms + psychological distress without medical disorder
- Factitious disorders or malingering: self-induced symptoms for primary or secondary gain

> Illness = response to disease (objective pathology)

One does not require the other and either can exist by itself. Somatoform disorders essentially are an illness but without a disease. **Illness behaviour** refers to how patients interpret and process their symptoms with their approach to resolving their illness. This becomes **abnormal illness behaviour** when there is ongoing inappropriate behaviour regarding their health eg. once they do not accept doctor's advice.

Also known as somatic symptom disorder, Briquet's syndrome.
Characterised by excessive distress secondary to physical symptoms
Risk factors correspond with historical ideas of hysteria ie. female, starts after menarche. In the males, corresponds with ASPD and alcohol abuse.
75% have Axis I comorbidities including MDD, dysthymic disorder, panic disorder and/or substance use. 66% meet criteria for Axis II disorders including avoidant, paranoid, OCPD and histrionic.
Typical picture: "always sickly" with medically unexplained symptoms since early adolescence, long lists of medication "allergies" and extensive medical documentation.

Comorbidity with depressive illness, panic disorder or substance abuse in up to 75%.
Comorbidity with personality disorders in up to 66%.
- **Management**
  - Biological: treat any comorbid Axis I
  - Psychological
    - Psychoeducation: due to underlying poor insight
  - Social
  - Establish a single care provider (most likely primary care)
  - Maintain regular appointments irregardless of symptoms, with regular physical examinations.
  - Taper appointments as per clinical response.
  - Avoid investigations unless objective signs observed.
  - Shift emphasis from somatic complaints to psychosocial stressors
  - Verify with collateral re encounters with clinicians and medications
  - Monitor for drug misuse, doctor-shopping and non-indicated surgeries.
- **Prognosis**: chronic and fluctuating
  - Providing the diagnosis: concerns of assessment of new symptoms
  - Not providing the diagnosis: repeated investigations, procedures and medications


## B7.3.3 Conversion disorder (WK)

- **Definition**: Essentially neurological impairment 
- **Clinical features**
  - Hoover's sign: in normals, voluntary hip flexion is associated with contralateral hip extension
  - Hip abductor sign
  - Drifting without pronation
  - Dragging gait
  - Give-way weakness
  - Co-contraction

## B7.3.4 Hypochondriasis (WK)

- **Definition**: fear or belief of serious disease due to misinterpretation of bodily symptoms despite objective evidence otherwise
- **Demographics**
  - Age of onset in early adulthood
  - Nil positive associations in family
  - M=F rates
- **Features**
  - Focus on potential diagnosis as opposed to symptom
  - Belief of symptom = disease; resulting in hypervigilance of bodily sensations
  - Feared illness becomes their identity
- **Clinical manifestations**
  - 4Ds
    - Disease conviction
    - Disease fear
    - Disease preoccupation
    - Disability ie. functional impairment
- **Comorbidity**
  - 88% in medical outpatient clinics have Axis I (GAD, dysthymia, MDD, somatisation disorder, panic disorder). Similar parallels with anxiety or personality disorder.
- **Management**
  - Improves with resolution of psychosocial stressors or mood and anxiety disorders
  - Psychoeducation for patient and family
  - Consider high-dose fluoxetine (similar to treating OCD) or CBT
