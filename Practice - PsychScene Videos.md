## MEQ 1

Olivia is a 29F, married mother of three children aged twelve months to eight years. She experienced significant sexual abuse in her childhood. Olivia has just been discharged to the local community mental health team at which you work, following a three-month admission to a nearby acute psychiatric inpatient unit. Prior to admission Olivia became depressed after hearing that her brother had been found guilty of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. She developed flashbacks and nightmares of her own experiences of abuse and had frequent panic attacks. She was found by her oldest child with a cord around her neck and admitted to hospital. Her hospital admission was characterised by recurrent episodes of self-harm including lacerating her arms and tying cords around her neck. She was treated with sodium valproate, paroxetine and diazepam. Olivia was eventually discharged on these medications and is still symptomatic.
