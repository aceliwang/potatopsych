You are a junior psychiatrist and Virginia is a 14 yr old girl who has been referred to your community mental health service by her family doctor who has diagnosed her as having chronic fatigue syndrome. Virginia has a two-year history of excessive tiredness and nonspecific physical symptoms. Virginia has had home schooling for the past year, avoids social settings and has a little contact with peers. She says she could do all things "if they were open at night when I am awake". She stays up watching television and talking to online internet chat rooms until 3 am and then sleeps until midday. Virginia's mother, Mrs Bennett, has stopped work so she can care for her daughter.

> Missed: communication, pre-ECT assessment, dosing threshold, EEG, monitoring post, continuation / maintenance

- Communication
  - Pre-educational survey: obtain current knowledge level of trainees, identify specific questions
  - Utilise practical tools in addition to the tutorial to deliver information: obtaining access to the ECT machine, demonstrating on models
  - Post-session feedback: answer questions and obtain feedback
  - **SMART** principles that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound
- Content regarding ECT
  - **Indication**: ECT is used primarily in affective, psychotic, catatonic illness and suicidality. Typically reserved for treatment-resistance despite pharmacology or where pharmacological management cannot be tolerated. Also utilised when quick response is required eg. nil eating or drinking.
  - **Background**: the efficacy of seizures was first discovered in patients with epilepsy and comorbid mental illness. Patients were observed to improve in their mental state following seizures. Through history, there have been attempts to first chemically induce seizures via camphor and then electrically via ECT. It is the gold-standard in treatment for affective illness.
  - **Before ECT**: there are no absolute contra-indications to ECT however caution must be utilised in patients with greater physical comorbidity. An anaesthetic assessment is essential to ensure that patients can tolerate both the anaesthesia and the resultant modified seizure. Assessment should include neurological and cardiorespiratory exam.
    - Baseline level of symptoms and cognition are also obtained via rating scales and cognitive screens
  - **First ECT**: patients will undergo titration to identify seizure threshold. Therapeutic dosages of ECT require levels above the seizure threshold depending on the electrode placement
  - **During ECT**: patients will undergo up to 3x/week of ECT with frequent monitoring of symptoms and side effects. At a minimum, after 6 sessions, cognition and symptom rating scales will be repeated and also at the end. ECT frequency and dosing can be adjusted during the session although it is expected that symptoms will only improve after 6 sessions. 
  - **After ECT**: ECT although highly efficacious acutely, is associated with high rates of relapse. Patients typically require pharmacotherapy to maintain remission of symptoms. Due to the time required for these medications to take effect, this should typically be started during the course of ECT. If medications are insufficient to maintain remission, patients may need continunation or maintenance ECT to maintain their mental state.
  - **Medications**: medications should be optimised depending on the indication of ECT. Previously non-efficacious medications should be ceased. Medications should be titrated to therapeutic dosages by the end of ECT. Concomitant medications involving anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines and lithium should be withheld on the morning of and the night prior to ECT administration due to effects on seizure quality and post-ictal delirium.
  - **Prescription**: date, session number, pulse width, electrode placement and dosing level should be recorded on prescription. EEG seizure quality and the previous comments by previous ECT sessions should be noted.
  - **Electrode placement**: conventional placements include right-unilateral, bifrontal or bitemporal with differing levels of efficacy and tendency to cause cognitive side effects
  - **EEG monitoring**

### MEQ 19.3 A medical student asks you to explain what the withdrawal and discontinuation syndromes one might experience from stopping an antipsychotic. How would you answer this question? (4 marks) 

> Structure:
> - Education: pre-education survey, teaching tools, post-education feedback
> - Typical withdrawal and discontinuation syndromes ie. antidepressants, drugs of addiction
> - Side effects of ceasing antipsychotic
> Missed:

- When addressing the student, I would first determine their level of understanding as to defining withdrawal, discontinuation syndrome and the mechanism of antipsychotics. I would also relate the answer to other medical specialties which the student may have a better understanding of
- Withdrawal is a syndrome secondary to cessation in context of dependence whether physical or psychological and typically is used in context of drugs of addiction such as alcohol, benzodiazepines or opiates. Due to prolonged use, patient's receptors are altered and thus with abrupt cessation, patients may have hyperactive receptor activity leading to uncomfortable states.
- Discontinuation syndrome is typically used in the context of antidepressant. It is distinct from withdrawal due to the lack of dependence, however it is noted that there is similarity in regards to an overdrive of receptor activity once the agent is ceased.
- Antipsychotics on the other hand do not exhibit the same tendency to upregulate however tapering or cessation of antipsychotics can result in psychotic relapse, depression and/or anxiety. 
- Finally, I would ask if they understood the above and whether they had any further questions
