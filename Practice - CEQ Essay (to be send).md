> There is a widespread desire to base our study of mental disorder on objective symptoms alone and ideally to disregard subjective symptoms altogether

Psychiatry is unique in medicine in that there remains robust debate about the nature of, and existence of, the diseases it seeks to treat. This is due to the widespread variation of mental disorders secondary to the "subjectivity [of] symptoms" which can introduce barriers to the diagnostic process as well as in research methodologies to generate evidence-based management guidelines. Although shifts towards relying on "objective symptoms" provides an opportunity to reduce these barriers, this essay shall explore the implications of relying solely on objective symptoms from a historical, ethical, cultural and recovery-orientated perspective and the progress psychiatry is undergoing to incorporate trauma-informed and recovery-orientated approaches, shaped by subjective symptoms and experiences, to facilitate recovery.

Firstly, understandings of illness have been subject to centuries of historical and sociocultural influence and is inherently "subjective" due to the impact of consumers' individual lived experience. Ignorance of the former can lead to irrevocable harms such as the historical dehumanisation and enduring stigmatisation of those identifying as homosexual, previously considered a psychiatric disorder. It should be recognised that the concept of mental disorders have existed since ancient Mesopotomia (Parys, 2014) and have changed over time. This is reflected within the evolution of diagnostic frameworks as evidenced through the iterative editions of the DSM from psychoanalytic, to neurobiological, to reverse-nosological conceptual understandings of disease (Aftab, 2021). Diagnostic terms and labels for mental disorders can therefore never be fully objective as they are neither fixed nor universal and must be constantly scrutinised. 

Thus, from a principle-based ethics perspective, the diagnostic process must be conducted with care in recognition of the vast implications of its outcomes. At its worst, so-called "objective" criteria have been used to diagnose "sluggish schizophrenia" (Merskey, 1986), violating individuals' autonomy, to suppress political dissidents in the Soviet Union historically. Although mental illness can be diagnosed, in line with beneficent principles to further biopsychosocial management and unlock essential supports and resources, the duty of non-maleficence requires psychiatrists to consider the extensive ramifications of diagnosis and its subjective factors, particularly when misused within the legal, forensic and insurance settings which reduce consumers to labels and ignore the true extent of their psychological distress and functional impairment (RANZCP Position Statement 77).  Reflection upon these flaws and past errors supported by the psychiatric field not only reinforces the recommitment to ethics but also the need for psychiatrists to advocate upon those deemed mentally ill. Such an approach ultimately enables the psychiatric discipline to strive towards elimination of discrimination against our consumers (RANZCP Code of Ethics 11) by appreciating each consumer's subjective experience. 

Concomitantly, alternative experiences of illness can arise from different cultural contexts, introducing further subjectivity. For example, the First Nations people prioritise a holistic model of health, with greater consideration of familial and spiritual well-being. However, current practice guidelines and diagnostic systems such as the DSM-5-TR have been primarily developed from data collected in Western nations. Implementing this medical model of mental illness upon marginalised groups including the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD), Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Others (LGBTQ+) and First Nations populations not only ignores critical aspects of their concept of health, but also reinforces the power imbalances present from historical oppression eg. the Stolen Generation which manifest both in outcomes ie. increased rates of psychoses and suicides and also higher rates of discrimination, as reflected within the disproportional rates of involuntary assessments and incarceration of First Nations peoples. Reconciliation of the intergenerational trauma and lived experience of First Nations people thus highlights the need and appreciation for individualised care. Fortunately, this has been recognised by the incorporation of trauma-informed principles into practice (RANZCP Position Statement 100) and the introduction of peer support workers and Aboriginal Liaison Officers into multidisciplinary care represent a shift towards cultural sensitivity and holistic care (RANZCP Position Statement 50), in line with the recovery model. Thus, it is important to prioritise the integration of cultural safety, acknowledging the shortcomings of applying conventional models of care, which have shifted towards the reliance on objective criteria, to support the wellbeing of different cultural groups including Indigenous communities, their Elders and beyond.

Finally, public psychiatry is encompassed by schizophrenia-spectrum illnesses where lack of insight or anosognosia is common leading to barriers against shared decision making, regardless of the reliance upon objective symptoms to inform diagnoses. This can impair the cultivation of the therapeutic alliance which is recognised as a central tenet to the recovery process (RANZCP CPG for Mood Disorders). However, this may be set aside in the pursuit of biological management for objective symptoms as experienced in my early training rotations in inpatient roles. Such involuntary management compounded by restrictive environments, potential paranoia and perceptual disturbances is often highly traumatising and although can lead to short-term "improvement", more often impairs consumers' ability and motivation to participate in long-term preventative care and rehabilitation, perpetuating a vicious cycle of re-traumatisation when they become unwell. 

Adoption of Open Dialogue Model strategies (Sekkila et al, 1990s) by conducting team discussions and reflections in the presence of consumers and carers, provides opportunity to promote patient centred care and limited enhancement of autonomy within the involuntary setting, in line with the recovery model taking into account consumers' subjective symptoms. Participation in Balint groups has developed appreciation of the impact and harms of traditional paternalistic practice and reaffirms our roles as a collaborator and advocate (CANMEDS, 2015) to participating in and promoting shared-decision making. Affording consumers the dignity of risk (Ibrahim and Davis, 2014) in care decisions, can lead to development of insight, promoting empowerment and advocacy and enhance the therapeutic alliance which ultimately requires understanding of a consumer's subjective experience.

It is therefore important to recognise the complex and multi-faceted nature of psychiatry that extends beyond conventional medical models of assessment and management that have moved towards "objective criteria". Focusing only on the latter neglects the holistic picture and can damage the therapeutic alliance, disempower consumers and complicate the recovery process. Psychiatry has evolved in its shift towards patient-centred care as reflected within the implementation of trauma-informed principles, cultural safety and recovery-orientated strategies and demonstrates the requirement for ongoing examination and scrutinisation of its practice to provide benefit to its consumers and society as a whole.
