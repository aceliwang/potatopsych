Involuntary outpatient treatment needs to consider the polarity of beneficience and autonomy. Beneficience with a tinge of utilitarinism involves the belief that psychiatrists are mitigating the symptoms of mental illness that place the patient or others at risk whilst autonomy prioritises the individual's rights to conduct their own decisions, which is essentially robbed in the case of involuntary treatment. Further considerations include the likelihood of relapse without treatment, the availability of such treatment and otherwise attempts to reduce the infringement of autonomy with involvement of the patient and their carers in treatment planning.
