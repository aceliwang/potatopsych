  - EEG negative
  - Benztropine
- New meds: olanzapine 2.5mg by GP due to hallucinations the day prior, unclear if given
  - Quetiapine ceased during earlier admission for COVID. 
- Progress
  - EDMO: decorticate posturing, waxy flexibility in regards to extension
  - Mirtazapine and olanzapine withheld
  - Benztropine given IV, GCS back to 14-15 unclear what response. Differing documentations.
  - Started on clonazepam 0.25mg BD
  - EEG NAD
  - Ongoing intermittent episodes of stiffness, one resolved after sternal rub
  - Refusal of food, afraid of staff
  - CL Psych consult
    - Likely delirium. Provided choice of antipsychotics of risperidone 0.5 or haloperidol 0.25mg if things do not improve
  - Noted moving all four limbs
  - MRI-B shows FTD: frontal involutional atrophy
  - Clonazepam ceased, quetiapine restarted, increased to 25mg BD
  - Neuro refused to do OPMH consult as "not eligible to be reviewed" as per neuro boss

# General Principles
- Older people's pharmacodynamics
  - Autonomic insufficiency over time leads to more severe side effects
  - Increased sensitivity to medications as well
  - May take longer to work
  - Bigger consequences of side effects eg. constipation leading to delirium, hypotension leading to falls
  - Higher risk of side effects:
    - Antipsychotics causing stroke
    - Clozapine causing agranulocytosis
    - SSRIs causing bleeding
  - Pharmacokinetics
    - Absorption slows due to decreased gut motility
    - More body fat leads into increased volume of distrubtion and longer duration of action
    - Kidney function tends to be worse, can build up lithium and amisulpride


## SEROTONIN SYNDROME IN THE ELDERLY
- 25% of elderly develop serotonin syndrome
  - 2/3s of which have potentially life-threatening symptoms
  - Typically due to SSRIs + SGAs
- More common in the elderly
- Most common symptoms with tremor and hyperreflexia
- Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria
  - Cause
    - Recent increase in serotonergic drug
  - Symptom
    - Spontaneous clonus
    - Inducible conus + agitation or diarphoresis
    - Ocular clonus + agitation + diaphroesis
    - Tremor and hyperreflexia
    - Hypertonia + fever + ocular or inducible clonus

- Mx
  - Discontinue agent
  - Supportive care: fluids, oxygen
  - Sedation with benzos to prevent muscle rigidity
  - Cyprohetadine acts as a serotonin antagonist but with strong antihistaminergic effects to provide sedation
- SS vs NMS
  - SS is quicker onset, within hours. NMS takes afew days.
  - SS causes clonus, tremors and hyperreflexia
  - NMS shows lead-pipe rigidity

## ACUTE DYSTONIA
- Rare in the elderly

## More likely pseudoparkinsonism symptoms
- Rigidity with occasional tremor
- Tremor was inconsistent
- Would fit demographically
- Nil obvious cause of a precipitating agent

##


Benzodiazepines in the elderly
Overly prescribed in 65+ with up to 13% of all BZD prescriptions
Has been on many lists to not be utilised for geriatric patients
Mostly used in old people for sleep and anxiety
Older people have increased sensitivity and decreased metabolism with the below adverse effects

## Indications
- Effects: hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscular relaxant, amnesic
- Acute anxiety and agitation
- Catatonia
- Seizure disorders
- Alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal
- Anaesthesia
- Avoid use for sleep: BZD-induced sleep is different to normal sleep as per EEG with typical rebound insomnia
- Chronic use is deterred by tolerance, dependence and withdrawal

## Choices
- Clonazepam
  - Advantages: subcutaneous
  - Dosing: start at 0.5mg, normal 1-2mg/day. Max 4mg/day.
- Diazepam
  - Advantages: intravenous
  - Dosing: start at 1mg TDS, max 7.5-15mg/day.
- Lorazepam
  - Advantages: short-acting, therefore maintain PRN
  - Dosing: start at 0.5mg daily, 0.5-2mg daily, 2mg daily

## Concerns
- Precipitating and prolonging delirium
- Dependence
- Ataxia, lethargy, confusion
- Increased falls risk with hip fractures
- Inability to drive, anterograde amnesia
- Withdrawal: seizure
- Paradoxical disinhibition with aggression, excitement, hostility, rage
- Respiratory depression WHEN combined with other sedatives
- ?long-term risk of dementia and cognitive impairment
  - Controversial due to nil dose-response association
  - Up to six months post cessation

## Guidelines
- Essentially no guidelines suggesting long-term use
  - Maudsley says max 4 weeks
  - French says 4 weeks for hypnotic (short-acting), 12 weeks for anxiolytics (long-acting)
- AGS suggests avoiding BZDs in 65+, particularly anyone at risk of the above
- Despite this, a third of older adults are prescribed long-term. Typically used for insomnia.
- Prefer long-acting over short-acting

## Management of Overdose
- Flumazenil: benzodiazepine antagonist

## Management
- Consider purpose and utilise alternative
  - Sleep hygiene or CBT for sleep. Consider melatonin or Z_drugs.
  - Antipsychotics in agitation
  - Antipsychotics and/or antidepressants in BPSD
