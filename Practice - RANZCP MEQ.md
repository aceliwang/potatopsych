## 2023 AUG MEQ 4
### MEQ 4.1 Outline (list and justify) potential advantages and disadvantages of working with an Indigenous Health Worker when serving a remote Indigenous community. (11 marks)

### MEQ 4.2 The registrar reminds you that they will be conducting their first community review of Selwyn, a 23-year-old male patient following his return to the community from a secure forensic mental health unit. He had been admitted under a forensic order two years previously following an assault on an elderly relative during an episode of psychosis associated with methamphetamine use. Although the forensic order was imposed in the context of a schizophrenia diagnosis, at discharge a change of diagnosis was being considered to moderate Intellectual Disability of unknown cause with specific deficits in impulse control and verbal reasoning. The patient has responded well to a small dose of an atypical antipsychotic medication with no recorded side effects. Outline (list and justify) dynamic factors associated with the likelihood of Selwyn being incarcerated in the future. (12 marks)

- Clinical
  - Untreated mental illness. Diagnosis may change in context of the formulation. If the patient has a schizophrenia diagnosis, there is risk of relapse with associated aggression leading to incarceration. Patient may be undertreated

  - Non-compliance with antipsychotics. Medication may either be treating psychosis or can also reduce aggression associated with impulse control. If becomes non-compliant, aggression may occur leading to incarceration
- Social
  - Lack of stable employment
  - Lack of stable accommodation
  - Current supports available
- Risk

## 2022 AUG MEQ 4
You are a junior consultant psychiatrist in an acute psychiatric inpatient unit attached to a teaching hospital. You are considering prescribing an antipsychotic medication for a young female science student, Nicolette, who has presented with a first episode psychosis. You requested a baseline ECG and it has come back "unremarkable". Nicolette asks you about the ECG trace. 

### MEQ 4.1 List the elements involved in interpreting an ECG trace recording. (5 marks) 

- Confirm demographic information
- Review for physical symptoms
- Discuss current medications, previous cardiac history and family history of cardiac issues
- Assess rate: tachycardic, normocardic or bradycardic
- Assess rhythm: regular, irregular, regularly irregular
- Assess axis: can determine hypertrophy
- Interpret P wave: length and morphology
- Interpret PR interval: length and whether elevated/depressed
- Interpret QRS complex: width, presence of Q waves
- Interpret ST interval: whether depressed or elevated
- Interpret QT interval and its correction according to heart rate
- Interpret T wave: morphology
- Assess for presence of U waves
- **Missed**
  - Check if sinus
  - Check if any blocks
  - Compare with previous ECG

### MEQ 4.2 Outline (list and justify) the importance of monitoring the QTc interval in psychiatric patients. (12 marks)

> Structure:
> - Why QTc will be increased
> - Consequences of QTc being increased

- Long QTc can become ventricular arrhythmia such as Torsades de Pointes -> sudden cardiac death
  - QT interval is corrected by adjusting for heart rate to obtain QTc
  - QTc greater than 460ms in females and greater than 440ms in males are considered the high normal limits
  - QTc greater than 500ms has particularly high risk of progressing to Torsades de Pointes
- QTc can be increased at baseline depending on risk factors
  - Medical conditions eg. hyperthyroidism, anorexia nervosa can increase QTc
  - Cardiac conditions eg. left ventricular hypertrophy
  - Electrolyte disturbance eg. low magnesium, low calcium or low potassium
  - Other medications can also increase QTc eg. antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, methadone
- QTc may be further increased in psychiatric patients, primarily due to psychotropics
  - Antipsychotics eg. ziprasidone, amisulpride, haloperidol, high-dose antipsychotics or IV administered
  - Antidepressants eg. citalopram/escitalopram, TCAs, venlafaxine
  - Mood-stabilisers eg. lithium
  - The effects of these medications may be increased due to interactions
- **Missed**
  - Details of long QTc
  - Medical conditions and baseline QTc prolongation
    - Electrolyte disturbances
  - Lifestyle factors

### MEQ 4.3 Nicolette is prescribed an antipsychotic. A week later, her repeat ECG reveals a QTc interval of 480ms. Outline (list and justify) your approach to this finding. (8 marks) 

- Take a history
  - Assess for cardiac symptoms: palipitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, pre-syncope or syncope
  - Conduct a physical examination focusing on cardiovascular system
  - Assess her vitals including blood pressure, heart rate
  - If above are concerning, would consult Cardiology for advice on further management esp if QTc > 500
- Review ECG
  - Consider whether correction was correct in context of heart rate
  - Serial ECGs daily to monitor QTc: detect whether there are any changes longitudinally
  - Compare against ECG performed at baseline
- Investigations (1): serum levels of electrolytes including potassium, magnesium and calcium
- Management (1)
  - Decrease antipsychotic dose
  - Consider switch to antipsychotic with less propensity to prolong QTc eg. lurasidone, brexpiprazole
- **Missed**
  - Repeat ECG
  - Prior cardiac Hx
  - Review medications: anything else that can cause QTc prolongation, drug-drug interactions
  - Specify routine ECG monitoring eg. annually, medication changes
  - Risk vs benefit analysis regarding medications
  - Psychoeducation

Although they have both always enjoyed a small drink in tha evening, recently he has noticed an increase in the amount of alcohol she is drinking, finding numerous empty bottles in the bin.
