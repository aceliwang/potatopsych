# Psychopharmacology in Medical Comorbidities

B

## Principles

### Pharmacokinetics

- Absorption
  - Parental routes have rapid but less predictable absorption of drugs
  - Gastric absorption can be impaired by food, antacids and cholestyramine
- Metabolism
  - Avoid polypharmacy
  - 


## Conditions

### Cardiac

### Epilepsy

- Concerns
  - Increased psychiatric comorbidity in epilepsy (depression, anxiety, psychosis)
  - Increased suicide risk compared to general
- Overview
  - Seizure occurs, becomes lucid for days, psychosis or mania starts for a few days to weeks, typically without clear consciousness
- Approach
  - Optimise epilepsy treatment before psychotropics
  - Choose psychotropics carefully with anti-seizure properties
  - Start low, go slow. Note that any seizure-threshold lowering effects are dose-related
  - If seizures return, optimise anticonvulsant therapy or switch psychotropics
  - If inter-ictal: likely will require psychotropics

### Polypharmacy

### Pregnancy

- Concerns
  - Teratogenic and toxic effects towards foetus
  - Perinatal effects upon the mother
  - Breast milk transmission
  - Long-term behavioural consequences
  - Psychiatric relapse perinatally
- Antipsychotics
  - Increased rates of foetal malformation after first-trimester exposure
- Antidepressants
  - Withdrawal commonly observed in newborns with jitteriness and irritability
  - SSRIs typically are not associated with increased risks of major malformations
- Mood stabilisers
  - Lithium: Epstein abnormality particularly in first trimester (lower risk than stated)
  - Carbamazepine: teratogenic (neural tube defect)
  - Valproate: teratogenic (neural tube defect)
- Benzodiazepines
  - Diazepam: previously thought to increase rate of foetal oral cleft (not confirmed on later studies)
- Approach overview
  - Risk assessment
    - Benefits of improved function, prevention of relapse
    - Risks of relapse
  - Informed consent regarding continuing or not continuing medications
  - Keep to previously successful medications, aim for monotherapy
  - Aim to time medication dosages for minimal levels in breast milk
- Notes
  - Consider ECT in psychotic depression
