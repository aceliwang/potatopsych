- Principles
  - Individual- and family- centred approach
  - Holistic approach including personal, activity and environmental contexts
  - Promote their strengths
- Approach
  - (1) Comprehensive Needs Assessment: identify key strengths, challenges and needs
    - Medical evaluation should also be performed
    - Outcome determines management and whether diagnostic evaluation is required
    - Referral for supports does not require diagnostic evaluation to have occurred
  - (2) Diagnostic Evaluation
    - Determine whether ASD can explain the functional deficits or whether there are other modifiable factors
    - Stages: individual clinician and if inconclusive, consensus team evaluation
  - Essentially should be case-managed until outcome is determined
    - Allied health can contribute to either the Comprehensive Needs Assessment or the Consensus Team Diagnostic Evaluation
    - Psychologists can perform the individual clinicain diagnostic evaluation
    - Doctors can do everything except the consensus team evaluation because duh
  - Assessment should be conducted in all relevant settings however can include clinic
    - Community settings can be assessed via observation, recordings, interviewing the client or reports from other professionals

- Content
  - PMHx
