> Autonomy is the most important of all ethical considerations, or is it?

Psychiatry is unique in that there remains robust debate about the nature and the existence of the disorders it claims to treat. This extends beyond the academic sphere and is further amplified within the population of consumers and their carers. Despite the contention surrounding the understanding and acceptance of these illnesses, recovery as conceptualised by the reduction of distress, the development of insight and the removal of functional impairments as dictated by the patient can be navigated via establishement of the therapeutic alliance. Autonomy, defined as the right for a person to make informed decisions about their choices, is of the utmost importance in facilitating a consumer's willingness to engage in the therapeutic alliance which is essential to enable the recovery process. This essay will explore this concept from a historical, ethical and cultural lens and discuss the changes in psychiatry secondary to this belief, the deficits that still continue and the progress that has been made from my perspective as a psychiatry trainee.

Understandings of illness have been subject to decades of historical and sociocultural influence and remains unique due to a person's lived experience. Attempts at establishing models of illness and diagnostic frameworks date back to Ancient Egyptian Book of Hearts and have evolved as can be observed via the iterative editions of the DSM from psychoanalytical, to neurobiological, to reverse-nosological conceptual understandings of disease. This evolution reflects the fact that diagnostic terms are neither fixed nor universal, and instead are merely tools utilised for research, standardisation and communication, in the pursuit of scientific advancement. Autonomy and the capacity to provide informed consent is considered one of the core tenets of psychiatry however is often considered impaired due to the presence of psychotic symptoms secondary it their ?diagnosis of major mental illness. The progress from prior treatment of those considered mentally ill and institutionalisation into aslyums ?forced removal from society has gradually changed with greater autonomy being afforded to consumers such that the modern landscape of psychiatry is focused towards community management as opposed to institutionalisation. This understanding of disease, and further study has evidenced that recovery is possible to the extent of increased quality of life owing to this, as doubt  ?? emailed by relinquishing the control and agency of a consumer back into their own hands to determine their recovery process. From a ethical perspective, the practice of involving ??? is stemmed towards beneficience and concepts of utilitaianism to protect and relieve the distress of families, the carers and to reduce the risk of harm to others during psychotic episodes. ALthough this is a serious issue to be considered in the setting of public safety, an active attempt to restoring autonomy is not only beneficial but also enables the recovery process to relieve the ongoing strain upon clinical resources, particularly in ?? context such as the NSW mass resignation of staff specialists. Overall, the historical progress upon the diagnostic conceptualisation of disease exemplify the recovery process that is enabled by promoting the principles of autonomy.

Secondly, understandings of illness can arise due to differing cultural contexts leading to varying experiences. Non-Western cultures, including that of the First Nations people, have more holistic models of health, focusing on kinship, spirituality and family dynamics. Conventional models of psychiatric practice and practice guidlines are based upon data predominantly collected from Western Nations and thus when applied to marginalised populations including the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Others as well as the First Nations populations ??? their ability to recover within their own model of health, instead forcing medications upon them with little regard for their spiritual and holistic wellbeing. It is also important to consider the damage that has arised from historical injustices imposed upon the First Nations people with implementation of paternalistic policies that psychiatry has been complicit in designing, including that of the Stolen Generation which violated Aboriginals' autonomy to raise their families and introducing decades of intergenerational trauma which continues to be reflected within higher rates of substance use, suicide, psychosis and incarceration. Although the RANZCP has attempted to make amends (RANZCP Position Statement #) and contemporary practice has involved further involvement of peer workers and Aboriginal Liaison Health Workers to individualise care and to prioritise consumers of their autonomy and ??holistic recovery. Thus the estbalishment of autonomy is essential in further culturally informed care.

Lastly, anosognia or lack of insight is common among schizophenia-spectrum illnesses, thus providing barriers towards a consumer's ability to provide informed consent to make autonomus decisions. This also produces barriers towards shared decision-making and establishment of the therapeutic alliance which is an essential part of the recovery principles. Early training experiences within acute inpatient wards were focused primarily on involuntary and pharmacological management of psychotic relapses by giving patients antipsychotics to address the neurochemical imbalances in their brain. Further experiences in rehabilitation and community based role highlighted the impact and traumatising effects of these events leading to further impairments in establishing of the therapeutic alliance due to robbing them of their autonomy. Such experiences have led to my adoption of Sekkil et al.s principles of the Open Dialogue Model where there active discussion and reflection of a consumer's progress in front of the consumer and their carer. This practice has been well-receieved and provides enhancement of their autonomy, albeit limited, to preserve the therapeutic alliance to promote recovery. Thus, efforts to enhance autonomy are essential in removing barriers to facilitating the recovery process.

In conclusion, the practicwe of psychiatry and the recovery of consumers from the perspective of themselves, their carers and their treating clinicians has evolved over time with gradual attempts to restor atuonomy to those assessed as mentally ill. Despite the complexity of the field and the humans ???within, these progressive changes with a focus on prioritising autonomy as the most important ethical consideration ??? lead to the betterment of consumers and the wellbeing of society as a whole.

> There is a widespread desire to base our study of mental disorder on objective symptoms alone and ideally to disregard subjective symptoms altogether

Psychiatry is unique in medicine in that there remains robust debate about the nature of, and existence of, the diseases it seeks to treat. This is due to the widespread variation of mental disorders secondary to the "subjectivity [of] symptoms" which can introduce barriers to the diagnostic process as well as in research methodologies to generate evidence-based management guidelines. Although shifts towards relying on "objective symptoms" provides an opportunity to reduce these barriers, this essay shall explore the implications of relying solely on objective symptoms from a historical, ethical, cultural and recovery-orientated perspective and the progress psychiatry is undergoing to incorporate trauma-informed and recovery-orientated approaches, shaped by subjective symptoms and experiences, to facilitate recovery.

Firstly, understandings of illness have been subject to centuries of historical and sociocultural influence and is inherently "subjective" due to the impact of consumers' individual lived experience. Ignorance of the former can lead to irrevocable harms such as the historical dehumanisation and enduring stigmatisation of those identifying as homosexual, previously considered a psychiatric disorder. It should be recognised that the concept of mental disorders have existed since ancient Mesopotomia (Parys, 2014) and have changed over time. This is reflected within the evolution of diagnostic frameworks as evidenced through the iterative editions of the DSM from psychoanalytic, to neurobiological, to reverse-nosological conceptual understandings of disease (Aftab, 2021). Diagnostic terms and labels for mental disorders can therefore never be fully objective as they are neither fixed nor universal and must be constantly scrutinised. 

Thus, from a principle-based ethics perspective, the diagnostic process must be conducted with care in recognition of the vast implications of its outcomes. At its worst, so-called "objective" criteria have been used to diagnose "sluggish schizophrenia" (Merskey, 1986), violating individuals' autonomy, to suppress political dissidents in the Soviet Union historically. Although mental illness can be diagnosed, in line with beneficent principles to further biopsychosocial management and unlock essential supports and resources, the duty of non-maleficence requires psychiatrists to consider the extensive ramifications of diagnosis and its subjective factors, particularly when misused within the legal, forensic and insurance settings which reduce consumers to labels and ignore the true extent of their psychological distress and functional impairment (RANZCP Position Statement 77).  Reflection upon these flaws and past errors supported by the psychiatric field not only reinforces the recommitment to ethics but also the need for psychiatrists to advocate upon those deemed mentally ill. Such an approach ultimately enables the psychiatric discipline to strive towards elimination of discrimination against our consumers (RANZCP Code of Ethics 11) by appreciating each consumer's subjective experience. 

Concomitantly, alternative experiences of illness can arise from different cultural contexts, introducing further subjectivity. For example, the First Nations people prioritise a holistic model of health, with greater consideration of familial and spiritual well-being. However, current practice guidelines and diagnostic systems such as the DSM-5-TR have been primarily developed from data collected in Western nations. Implementing this medical model of mental illness upon marginalised groups including the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD), Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Others (LGBTQ+) and First Nations populations not only ignores critical aspects of their concept of health, but also reinforces the power imbalances present from historical oppression eg. the Stolen Generation which manifest both in outcomes ie. increased rates of psychoses and suicides and also higher rates of discrimination, as reflected within the disproportional rates of involuntary assessments and incarceration of First Nations peoples. Reconciliation of the intergenerational trauma and lived experience of First Nations people thus highlights the need and appreciation for individualised care. Fortunately, this has been recognised by the incorporation of trauma-informed principles into practice (RANZCP Position Statement 100) and the introduction of peer support workers and Aboriginal Liaison Officers into multidisciplinary care represent a shift towards cultural sensitivity and holistic care (RANZCP Position Statement 50), in line with the recovery model. Thus, it is important to prioritise the integration of cultural safety, acknowledging the shortcomings of applying conventional models of care, which have shifted towards the reliance on objective criteria, to support the wellbeing of different cultural groups including Indigenous communities, their Elders and beyond.

Finally, public psychiatry is encompassed by schizophrenia-spectrum illnesses where lack of insight or anosognosia is common leading to barriers against shared decision making, regardless of the reliance upon objective symptoms to inform diagnoses. This can impair the cultivation of the therapeutic alliance which is recognised as a central tenet to the recovery process (RANZCP CPG for Mood Disorders). However, this may be set aside in the pursuit of biological management for objective symptoms as experienced in my early training rotations in inpatient roles. Such involuntary management compounded by restrictive environments, potential paranoia and perceptual disturbances is often highly traumatising and although can lead to short-term "improvement", more often impairs consumers' ability and motivation to participate in long-term preventative care and rehabilitation, perpetuating a vicious cycle of re-traumatisation when they become unwell. 

Adoption of Open Dialogue Model strategies (Sekkila et al, 1990s) by conducting team discussions and reflections in the presence of consumers and carers, provides opportunity to promote patient centred care and limited enhancement of autonomy within the involuntary setting, in line with the recovery model taking into account consumers' subjective symptoms. Participation in Balint groups has developed appreciation of the impact and harms of traditional paternalistic practice and reaffirms our roles as a collaborator and advocate (CANMEDS, 2015) to participating in and promoting shared-decision making. Affording consumers the dignity of risk (Ibrahim and Davis, 2014) in care decisions, can lead to development of insight, promoting empowerment and advocacy and enhance the therapeutic alliance which ultimately requires understanding of a consumer's subjective experience.

It is therefore important to recognise the complex and multi-faceted nature of psychiatry that extends beyond conventional medical models of assessment and management that have moved towards "objective criteria". Focusing only on the latter neglects the holistic picture and can damage the therapeutic alliance, disempower consumers and complicate the recovery process. Psychiatry has evolved in its shift towards patient-centred care as reflected within the implementation of trauma-informed principles, cultural safety and recovery-orientated strategies and demonstrates the requirement for ongoing examination and scrutinisation of its practice to provide benefit to its consumers and society as a whole.

Biological smashing success Freud

Psychiatry is unique in that there remains robust debate about the nature and existence of the diseases it claims to treat. Throughout time, there has been an attempt to discover and understand the biological underpinnings of psychiatry, o align psychiatric practice within the conventional medical model to legitimise and fully grasp the pathophysiology of mental illness. Although this may be considered a “smashing success” in certain respects, with new treatments that have effectively rendered historical asylum care obsolete, this has developed into a shift away from the non-biological aspects including that of Freud’s ideas, which involved analysis of an individual’s subconscious and unconscious conflicts regarding their subjective lived experience and their psychosocial stressors. This essay shall explore the impacts including the benefits of pursuing the biological model in psychiatric practice as well as the danger of leaving non-biological aspects including “Freud’s ideas” in the past, and how psychiatry has been recognising the need for the latter by its incorporation of trauma-informed and recovery-oriented approaches into our understandings of illness to further the therapeutic alliance and to improve functional outcomes.

Understandings of illness have been subject to centuries of historical and sociocultural influences dating back to ancient Mesoptomia (Parys, 2014) where it was believed that mental illness was due to the actions and the will of gods. Attempts to study and understand mental illness led to the development of the DSM, which over time has changed its conceptual understandings of illness from psychoanalytical, to neurobiological, to reverse-nosological concepts. This pursuit of the biological model has facilitated the study and development of effective pharmacological agents to treat major mental illness such as psychoses and bipolar affective disorder. However, the biological model is yet able to fully explain the full extent of mental illness and ignorance of historical psychiatric practice can lead to irrevocable harms such as the dehumanisation and enduring stigmatisation of those identifying as homosexual, previously considered a mental illness. Thus, it should be recognised that diagnostic terms remain neither fixed nor universal and should be constantly scrutinised. Thus, from a principle-based ethics perspective, the diagnostic approach and ??? should be treated with care due to other vast implications of its outcomes. At its worst, psychiatric diagnoses have been intentionally misused to desecrate individual autonomy, violating the Hipporatic oath of do-no-harm, as evidenced by the use of “sluggish schizophrenia” (Merskey, 1986) to suppress political dissidents in the Soviet Union. However, mental illness can be diagnosed along beneficent principles to further biological management, and unlock existing supports and services. This may come with the peril of ignoring a consumer’s full psychological distress and functional impairment due to the shift away from psychosocial factors among those within Freud’s ideas. These harms are particularly evident when diagnoses are employed in the legal, forensic and insurance settings.  Reflection upon these flaws and past errors supported by the psychiatric field not only reinforces the need for psychiatrists t to consider the complete biopsychosocial formulation but also the need to advocate for those assessed as mentally ill.
Concomitantly, alternative experiences of illness can arise from different cultural contexts, which do not align with the standard medical and biological model of illness. For example, the First Nations people prioritise a holistic model of health with greater respect for familial and spiritual factors. However, current practice guidelines have primarily been developed from Western populations and although follow the biological approach, when enforced upon marginalised populations such as the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD), the Lesbian Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Others (LGBT+) and the First Nations people, can not only ignore the non-biological factors such as the psychosocial ideas including Freud’s ideas, but also reinforces the power imbalances present from historical oppression e.g. the Stolen Generations. These manifest as both increased rates of suicidal and pyschoses but also ongoing discrimination with higher rates of involuntary assessment and incarceration. Reconciliation of this intergenerational trauma and lived experience of First Nations people thus highlights the need and appreciation for individualised care. Fortunately, this has been recognised by the incorporation of trauma-informed principles into practice (RANZCP Position Statement 100) and the introduction of peer support workers and Aboriginal Liaison Officers into multidisciplinary care and represent a shift towards cultural sensitivity and holisticare care in line with the recovery model. Thus, although biological approaches have enabled the treatment of some aspects of mental illness, it is important to consider the Freudian ideas of psychoanalytical ??? and its interaction with culture for better care.

Finally, the pursuit of biological management encompassed my experience in the inpatient setting from my early experience as a a registrar. Such involuntary management compounded by restrictive environments, paranoia and sensory disturbances can be highly traumatising and although focus on the biological underpinnings, via use of antipsychotics led to short-term improvements measured by reduction in symptoms, this needs to be balanced with the consideration of the nonbiological factors including those of Freuds, as it prejudices consumers against participating in long-term preventative care and rehabilitation, perpetuating a viscious cycle of retraumatisation when unwell. Supervision in Balint groups has highlighted the impact and harms of traditional paternalistic practice to ??? along the biological approach and attests to our duties as a collaborator and advocate (CANMEDS 2015). This has led to my adoption of strategies from the Open Dialogue Model (Sekkilah, 2001) by conducting team discussions and reflections in the presence of consumers and carers to promote patient centred-care and to enhance autonomy, in line with the recovery model. 
In conclusion, it is important to recognise the complex and multifaciated nature of psychiatry that although has benefited from biological advancements, also requires consideration beyond the medical model. Neglecting the holistic picture can damage the therapeutic alliance, disengage consumers and complicate the recovery process. Psychiatry has evolved in its shift towards patient-centred care as reflected within incorporation of trauma-inofrmed principles, cultural safety and recovery-oriented strategies to the benefit of our consumers and society as a whole.

## Stigma - Timed

> “Being excluded blights the lives of the mentally ill. Exclusion is both cause and consequence of mental ill-health and extends beyond material deprivation to exclusion from the activities which give meaning to life.”

Psychiatry is unique in that there remains robust debate about the nature, and very existence, of the diseases it claims to treat. This discourse exists both within the psychiatric field itself but also extends to how mental illness is viewed by the general population, leading to stigmatisation and subsequent discrimination and "exclusion" of our consumers. This essay will explore the factors that have contributed to the development of stigma, its impact and its perpetuating nature as well as the steps that psychiatry are undertaking, with incorporation of trauma-informed and recovery-oriented approaches to further the recovery process and improve functional outcomes in the face of stigma.

*Stigma does not emerge from a vacuum, and develops on the back of centuries of historical and sociocultural influence.* The existence of mental disorders dates back to ancient Mesoptomia (Parys, 2014) where it was initially believed that mental illness manifested as a result of divine Gods, with subsequent moral implications being imposed upon the unwell. Despite advancements in our understandings of mental disorders including embracing of the biological model to break down stigma, the historical practice of psychiatry led to enduring stigma and exclusion of those considered mentally ill. For example, homosexuality's previous diagnosis as a mental disorder led to irrevocable harms of dehumanisation and exclusion, leading to ongoing issues with identity ??? ?INCLUDE DSM or not

From a beneficence ethical perspective, it is important for psychiatrists to advocate for those assessed as mentally ill due to the systemic discriminations against the mentally ill, particularly following the intentional misuse of psychiatric diagnoses as a political tool eg. the use of "sluggish schizophrenia" (Merskey, 1986) which was used to actively harm political dissidents in the Soviet Union by rationalising their detention and dehumanisation, thus leading to "exclusion" from not only activities which give meaning to life, but daily routine life in general. Thus, although psychiatric diagnosis within the medical model is essential to guide biopsychosocial management, it must be conducted with care and along non-maleficent principles due t othe harm and stigma that accompanies, particularly when these terms are used in legal, forensic and insurance settings, where the true extent of psychological distress and functional impairments are lost. Reflection upon these past flaws and errors reinforces the commitment to ethics.

Concomitantly, "exclusion" and stigmatisation also arises due to different understandings of health amid different cultural contexts. For example, First Nations people appreciate a holistic model of health with greater concern of familial and spiritual factors and this model does not always align with the general medical model that is utilised in contemporary hospital practice. Subsequently, lack of treatment response due to these discordant models of health can lead to development of stigma against certain marginalised populations, with internalised discrimination. Such prractice not only ignores critical aspects of their concept of health but also reinforces the power imbalances present from historical oppression, eg. the Stolen Generation ie. as a consequence of exclusion from Western society. This manifests as discrimination with increased rates of involuntary assessments and incaraceration as well as increased mental illness including higher rates of suicide and psychoses. Fortunately, psychiatry is incorporating peer support workers and Aboriginal Liaison Officers into multidsciplinary care for greater cultural sensitivty and accepance of their holistic model in line with the recovery model. Thus, it is improtant to prioritise the integration of cultural safety to support the wellbeing of different cultural groups including INdigineous communitieis and their Elders and beyond.

Finally, my experience within supervision in Balint groups have highlighted the traumtaising impact of conventional psychiatric practice. Involuntary detainment for the purpose of primarily biological management leads to further senses of exclusion as consumers are essentially removed from the general population. Although this is performed in beneficent principles to reduce the risk of immediate harms, such practices have long-term effects in facilitating participation in long-term preventative care and rehabilitation once symptoms are under control, leading to further stigmatisation and barriers to improve. This has led to my adoption of the Open Dialogue Model ideals (Sekkilar, 1990s), invloving providng a sense of auotonomy to patients in line with the recovery model and approaches to enhance the therapeutic alliance.

Ultimately, it s important to recognise the complex and multi-faceted nature of psychiatry that extends byoned traditional medical models of assessment and managing noting the impact of stigma that both contributes and eventuates from our practice. Psychiatry has fortunately shifted towards patient-centred care and recognises the influence of stigma, with incorporation of trauma-informed principles and recovery-oriented strategies, thus demonstrating the ongoing need for examination and scrutinisation of its practice to provide benefits to its consumers and society as a whole.

[The stigma of mental illness and its multifaceted pathway to recovery has persisted despite advancements in the psychiatric field.]
The stimulus suggests that [such stigma with subsequent exclusion from mainstream society can also cause and perpetuate mental illness further]. This essay will explore the [impact of such exclusion, psychiatry's role in its perpetuation] and the steps that psychiatry is undertaking to address this to further the recovery process and improve outcomes. 

HISTORY/ETHICS: 208/200
HISTORY TOPIC: Stigma and the subsequent exclusion of mental health consumers has developed in the context of centuries of historical and sociocultural influence. 
EXAMPLE: For example, homosexuality was previously considered a psychiatric illness in earlier editions of the DSM and its unacceptability led to the development of dehumanising practices such as conversion therapy.  
EXPLAIN: This "mental illness" manifested from its perceived incompatibility with traditional Christian values and exclusion from Christian populations and also led to ongoing discriminatory practices that have contributed to the evolution of gender dysphoria disorder. This residual stigma continues to manifest as distress related to homosexual identification in conservative communities with subsequent disproportionate suicide rates as well as ongoing barriers against seeking help and care. 

ETHICS TOPIC: Furthermore, from a principle-based ethics perspective, the use of psychiatric diagnoses is essential to provide beneficence to guide biopsychosocial management. However, it must also be approached with caution due to its potential for misuse, thus violating non-maleficent ideals.
EXAMPLE: Historically, a diagnosis of "sluggish schizophrenia" was used to suppress and institutionalise political dissidents in the Soviet Union, thus excluding them from daily "activities" and leading to their subsequent dehumanisation.
LINK: Reflection upon these flaws and past errors supported by the psychiatric field not only reinforces the requirement of recommitment to ethics but also the need for psychiatrists to advocate upon those deemed mentally ill.

CULTURAL: 193/200
TOPIC: Concomitantly, the impacts of stigma can also be observed within the practice of psychiatry within alternative cultures in Australia.
EXAMPLE: For example, the exclusion of the First Nations population as people due to the racism and exclusion from early colonisers led to development of discriminatory policies including that of the Stolen Generation of which psychiatry was complicit (RANZCP Position Statement 42).
EXPLAIN: The subsequent intergenerational trauma is reflected not only within discordant rates of mental illness including higher prevalence of suicides and psychoses but also manifests within consequent systemic discrimination including higher rates of involuntary assessment and incarceration. 
**LINK: Reconciliation of the intergenerational trauma and lived experience of First Nations people thus highlights the need for psychiatrists to advocate for its consumers.** 
IMPROVEMENT: Fortunately, there has been increased incorporation of Aboriginal Liaison Officers and peer workers into the multidisciplinary team to incorporate both a holistic model of care and to align the healthcare system with the recovery model.
LINK: Thus, the integration of cultural sensitivity and inclusion of aspects from alternative models of health is vital in supporting the wellbeing of different cultural groups including that of the First Nations communities.

CLINICAL: 203/200
- TOPIC: Finally, my participation in Balint supervision groups have highlighted the excluding nature of conventional public psychiatric practice, which can potentiate ongoing mental illness within its consumers.
- EXAMPLE: Involuntary detainment, compounded by paranoia and hallucinations, with forced injections of biological therapies and their removal from existing community supports and mainstream society, can be highly traumatising.
- EXPLAIN: Although in line with beneficent principles to reduce clinical distress and the risk of consumers towards both themselves and others via biological approaches, the paternalistic and traumatising nature of their experiences within psychiatrist practice may preclude their participation in rehabilitation and long-term preventative care, leading to a perpetual and vicious cycle when they unfortunately become unwell again. 
- LINK: 
- IMPROVEMENT: This has led to my adoption of Open Dialogue Model strategies, which involves conducting team discussions and reflections in the presence of consumers and their carers. 
- EXPLAIN: This provides an opportunity to enhance patient-centred care and restores a limited degree of autonomy back to the consumer to further the therapeutic alliance and promote their recovery process.
- LINK: Such shared-decision practice reaffirms our roles as collaborators and advocates for our consumers (CANMEDS, 2015) to [address their exclusion and address such perpetuating factors]

CONCLUSION: 88/50
Ultimately, it is important to recognise the complex and multi-faceted nature of psychiatry that extends beyond traditional medical models of assessment and management. [Recognition of the interplay between stigma and mental illness necessitates the need for psychiatrists to advocate for its consumers to both prevent the incidence of mental illness and reduce barriers impairing the recovery process.] Fortunately, psychiatry is shifting towards patient-centred care, in line with the recovery model, by incorporating trauma-informed practice and recovery-oriented principles, to the benefit of its consumers and society as a whole.

> “Being excluded blights the lives of the mentally ill. Exclusion is both cause and consequence of mental ill-health and extends beyond material deprivation to exclusion from the activities which give meaning to life.”

The stigma associated with mental health and its complex multifaceted pathway to recovery has long persisted despite the evolution of psychiatry as a medical field. Such stigma has consequently led to the exclusion of mentallly ill patients from mainstream society which further impairs their recovery process and causes ongoing poor mental health. This essay will explore the impact of stigma and exclusion, psychiatry's role in its perpetuation as well as the other factors that contribute to mental illness and the steps that psychiatry is taking to address the above to further the therapeutic alliance and improve outcomes.

Firstly, stigma and exclusion is a consequence of centuries of historical and sociocultural influence. For example, the exclusion of homosexuals from traditional conversative communities due to its incompatability with Christian values led to its prior classification within the DSM as a psychiatric disorder. This was utilised to justify the need for conversion therapy and has led to irrevocable harms with ongoing residual seclusion in certain communities. The lack of acceptance and exclusion from such communities has caused the development of gender dysphoria disorder, leading to disproportionaly increased rates of suicide and ongoing barriers to seeking care for those identifying as queer within such exclusionary populations. Thus from a principle-based ethics perspective, the use of psychiatric diagnosis must be proceeded with caution to align with non-malificent principles, due to its vast ramifications. This can be seen via the misuse of psychiatry for political agendas. The use of "sluggish schizophrenia" (Parys 2014) was used to suppress political dissendents in the Soviet Union and as rationale to exclude them and further dehumanise them leading to institutionalisation and "deprivation ... from activities which give meaning to life". Reflection upon these flaws and past errors supported by the psychiatric field not only reinforces our recommitment to ethics but also the need for psychiatrists to advocate upon those deemed mentally ill.

Concomitantly, the impact of exclusionary practices can also be observed within a cultural lens. The First Nations people have been subject to intergenerational trauma following exclusion from the previous Western colonisers leading to development of discriminatory policies such as of the Stolen Generations, of which psychiatry was complicit with (RANZCP Position Statement 42). Not only did this contribute to the cause of increased mental illness reflected with higher rates of suicide and psychoses but also has led to the consequence of disproportionate rates of involuntary assessment, detention and incarceration (Closing the Gap, 2013), thus perpetuating the incidence of mental illness. These barriers to recovery also arise due to historical exclusion of alternative models of care. For example, the First Nations people have a more holistic understanding of health with greater appreciation for familial and spiritual factors. Its lack of alignment with the traditional medical model and conventional Western public psychiatry leads to barriers in addressing all aspects of health, thus perpetuating mental illness in its consumers. Fortunately, this has been recognised and steps have been made to address these with the incorporation of Aboriginal Liaison Officers and Peer Support workers into the multidisciplinary team to address these deficiences and to align the healthcare system with a holistic model of care, in line with recovery principles, to facilitate access to the "activities which give meaning to life". The integration of cultural sensitivity and inclusion of aspects from alternative models of health is thus vital in supporting the wellbeing of different cultures including of the First Nations people.

The focus upon personalised medicine and its complex pathway to recovery, with attempts to break down stigma, is however not immune to pressures of the clinical environment. My participation in Balint supervision groups have highlighted the fact that conventional inpatient psychiatric practice, in the context of involuntary detention, injections of biological therapies and removal ie. exclusion from general society and from their informal supports, can be highly traumatising. Although performed in line with beneficent principles, to reduce distress from symptoms and manage their risk towards self and others, such practices can further exclude their participation from rehabilitation and long-term preventative care with subsequent perpetuation of a vicious cycle when they relapse. Thus a balance must be sought in providing beneficent care but also to consider the harms associated with our practice. This has led to my adoption of strategies from the Open Dialogue Model (Sekkilah, 1990s). The conduct of team discussions and reflections in the presence of consumers and carers provide an opportunity to limit their exclusion within the hospital environment, and shift towards patient-centred care  to enhance the therapeutic alliance and promote their recovery. Such shared-decision practice reaffirms our roles as collaborators and advocates for our consumers (CANMEDS 2015).

Ultimately, it is important to recognise the complex and multi-faceted nature of psychiatry that extends beyond traditional medical models of assessment and management. Recognition of the interplay between stigma and mental illness necessitates the need for psychiatrists to advocate for its consumers both to limit exclusion as a consequence but also to reduce its role in its perpetuation and cause of mental illness. Fortunately, psychiatry is shifting towards patient-centred care, in line with the recovery model with its incorporation of trauma-informed practice and recovery-oriented principles, to the benefit of consumers and society as a whole.
