> Autonomy is the most important of all ethical considerations, or is it?

Psychiatry is unique in that there remains robust debate about the nature and the existence of the disorders it claims to treat. This extends beyond the academic sphere and is further amplified within the population of consumers and their carers. Despite the contention surrounding the understanding and acceptance of these illnesses, recovery as conceptualised by the reduction of distress, the development of insight and the removal of functional impairments as dictated by the patient can be navigated via establishement of the therapeutic alliance. Autonomy, defined as the right for a person to make informed decisions about their choices, is of the utmost importance in facilitating a consumer's willingness to engage in the therapeutic alliance which is essential to enable the recovery process. This essay will explore this concept from a historical, ethical and cultural lens and discuss the changes in psychiatry secondary to this belief, the deficits that still continue and the progress that has been made from my perspective as a psychiatry trainee.

Understandings of illness have been subject to decades of historical and sociocultural influence and remains unique due to a person's lived experience. Attempts at establishing models of illness and diagnostic frameworks date back to Ancient Egyptian Book of Hearts and have evolved as can be observed via the iterative editions of the DSM from psychoanalytical, to neurobiological, to reverse-nosological conceptual understandings of disease. This evolution reflects the fact that diagnostic terms are neither fixed nor universal, and instead are merely tools utilised for research, standardisation and communication, in the pursuit of scientific advancement. Autonomy and the capacity to provide informed consent is considered one of the core tenets of psychiatry however is often considered impaired due to the presence of psychotic symptoms secondary it their ?diagnosis of major mental illness. The progress from prior treatment of those considered mentally ill and institutionalisation into aslyums ?forced removal from society has gradually changed with greater autonomy being afforded to consumers such that the modern landscape of psychiatry is focused towards community management as opposed to institutionalisation. This understanding of disease, and further study has evidenced that recovery is possible to the extent of increased quality of life owing to this, as doubt  ?? emailed by relinquishing the control and agency of a consumer back into their own hands to determine their recovery process. From a ethical perspective, the practice of involving ??? is stemmed towards beneficience and concepts of utilitaianism to protect and relieve the distress of families, the carers and to reduce the risk of harm to others during psychotic episodes. ALthough this is a serious issue to be considered in the setting of public safety, an active attempt to restoring autonomy is not only beneficial but also enables the recovery process to relieve the ongoing strain upon clinical resources, particularly in ?? context such as the NSW mass resignation of staff specialists. Overall, the historical progress upon the diagnostic conceptualisation of disease exemplify the recovery process that is enabled by promoting the principles of autonomy.

Secondly, understandings of illness can arise due to differing cultural contexts leading to varying experiences. Non-Western cultures, including that of the First Nations people, have more holistic models of health, focusing on kinship, spirituality and family dynamics. Conventional models of psychiatric practice and practice guidlines are based upon data predominantly collected from Western Nations and thus when applied to marginalised populations including the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Others as well as the First Nations populations ??? their ability to recover within their own model of health, instead forcing medications upon them with little regard for their spiritual and holistic wellbeing. It is also important to consider the damage that has arised from historical injustices imposed upon the First Nations people with implementation of paternalistic policies that psychiatry has been complicit in designing, including that of the Stolen Generation which violated Aboriginals' autonomy to raise their families and introducing decades of intergenerational trauma which continues to be reflected within higher rates of substance use, suicide, psychosis and incarceration. Although the RANZCP has attempted to make amends (RANZCP Position Statement #) and contemporary practice has involved further involvement of peer workers and Aboriginal Liaison Health Workers to individualise care and to prioritise consumers of their autonomy and ??holistic recovery. Thus the estbalishment of autonomy is essential in further culturally informed care.

Lastly, anosognia or lack of insight is common among schizophenia-spectrum illnesses, thus providing barriers towards a consumer's ability to provide informed consent to make autonomus decisions. This also produces barriers towards shared decision-making and establishment of the therapeutic alliance which is an essential part of the recovery principles. Early training experiences within acute inpatient wards were focused primarily on involuntary and pharmacological management of psychotic relapses by giving patients antipsychotics to address the neurochemical imbalances in their brain. Further experiences in rehabilitation and community based role highlighted the impact and traumatising effects of these events leading to further impairments in establishing of the therapeutic alliance due to robbing them of their autonomy. Such experiences have led to my adoption of Sekkil et al.s principles of the Open Dialogue Model where there active discussion and reflection of a consumer's progress in front of the consumer and their carer. This practice has been well-receieved and provides enhancement of their autonomy, albeit limited, to preserve the therapeutic alliance to promote recovery. Thus, efforts to enhance autonomy are essential in removing barriers to facilitating the recovery process.

In conclusion, the practicwe of psychiatry and the recovery of consumers from the perspective of themselves, their carers and their treating clinicians has evolved over time with gradual attempts to restor atuonomy to those assessed as mentally ill. Despite the complexity of the field and the humans ???within, these progressive changes with a focus on prioritising autonomy as the most important ethical consideration ??? lead to the betterment of consumers and the wellbeing of society as a whole.
