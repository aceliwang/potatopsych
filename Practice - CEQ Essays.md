> Autonomy is the most important of all ethical considerations, or is it?

Psychiatry is unique in that there remains robust debate about the nature and the existence of the disorders it claims to treat. This extends beyond the academic sphere and is further amplified within the population of consumers and their carers. Despite the contention surrounding the understanding and acceptance of these illnesses, recovery as conceptualised by the reduction of distress, the development of insight and the removal of functional impairments as dictated by the patient can be navigated via establishement of the therapeutic alliance. Autonomy, defined as the right for a person to make informed decisions about their choices, is of the utmost importance in facilitating a consumer's willingness to engage in the therapeutic alliance which is essential to enable the recovery process. This essay will explore this concept from a historical, ethical and cultural lens and discuss the changes in psychiatry secondary to this belief, the deficits that still continue and the progress that has been made from my perspective as a psychiatry trainee.

Understandings of illness have been subject to decades of historical and sociocultural influence and remains unique due to a person's lived experience. Attempts at establishing models of illness and diagnostic frameworks date back to Ancient Egyptian Book of Hearts and have evolved as can be observed via the iterative editions of the DSM from psychoanalytical, to neurobiological, to reverse-nosological conceptual understandings of disease. This evolution reflects the fact that diagnostic terms are neither fixed nor universal, and instead are merely tools utilised for research, standardisation and communication, in the pursuit of scientific advancement. Autonomy and the capacity to provide informed consent is considered one of the core tenets of psychiatry however is often considered impaired due to the presence of psychotic symptoms secondary it their ?diagnosis of major mental illness. The progress from prior treatment of those considered mentally ill and institutionalisation into aslyums ?forced removal from society has gradually changed with greater autonomy being afforded to consumers such that the modern landscape of psychiatry is focused towards community management as opposed to institutionalisation. This understanding of disease, and further study has evidenced that recovery is possible to the extent of increased quality of life owing to this, as doubt  ?? emailed by relinquishing the control and agency of a consumer back into their own hands to determine their recovery process. From a ethical perspective, the practice of involving ??? is stemmed towards beneficience and concepts of utilitaianism to protect and relieve the distress of families, the carers and to reduce the risk of harm to others during psychotic episodes. ALthough this is a serious issue to be considered in the setting of public safety, an active attempt to restoring autonomy is not only beneficial but also enables the recovery process to relieve the ongoing strain upon clinical resources, particularly in ?? context such as the NSW mass resignation of staff specialists. Overall, the historical progress upon the diagnostic conceptualisation of disease exemplify the recovery process that is enabled by promoting the principles of autonomy.

Secondly, understandings of illness can arise due to differing cultural contexts leading to varying experiences. Non-Western cultures, including that of the First Nations people, have more holistic models of health, focusing on kinship, spirituality and family dynamics. Conventional models of psychiatric practice and practice guidlines are based upon data predominantly collected from Western Nations and thus when applied to marginalised populations including the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Others as well as the First Nations populations ??? their ability to recover within their own model of health, instead forcing medications upon them with little regard for their spiritual and holistic wellbeing. It is also important to consider the damage that has arised from historical injustices imposed upon the First Nations people with implementation of paternalistic policies that psychiatry has been complicit in designing, including that of the Stolen Generation which violated Aboriginals' autonomy to raise their families and introducing decades of intergenerational trauma which continues to be reflected within higher rates of substance use, suicide, psychosis and incarceration. Although the RANZCP has attempted to make amends (RANZCP Position Statement #) and contemporary practice has involved further involvement of peer workers and Aboriginal Liaison Health Workers to individualise care and to prioritise consumers of their autonomy and ??holistic recovery. Thus the estbalishment of autonomy is essential in further culturally informed care.

Lastly, anosognia or lack of insight is common among schizophenia-spectrum illnesses, thus providing barriers towards a consumer's ability to provide informed consent to make autonomus decisions. This also produces barriers towards shared decision-making and establishment of the therapeutic alliance which is an essential part of the recovery principles. Early training experiences within acute inpatient wards were focused primarily on involuntary and pharmacological management of psychotic relapses by giving patients antipsychotics to address the neurochemical imbalances in their brain. Further experiences in rehabilitation and community based role highlighted the impact and traumatising effects of these events leading to further impairments in establishing of the therapeutic alliance due to robbing them of their autonomy. Such experiences have led to my adoption of Sekkil et al.s principles of the Open Dialogue Model where there active discussion and reflection of a consumer's progress in front of the consumer and their carer. This practice has been well-receieved and provides enhancement of their autonomy, albeit limited, to preserve the therapeutic alliance to promote recovery. Thus, efforts to enhance autonomy are essential in removing barriers to facilitating the recovery process.

In conclusion, the practicwe of psychiatry and the recovery of consumers from the perspective of themselves, their carers and their treating clinicians has evolved over time with gradual attempts to restor atuonomy to those assessed as mentally ill. Despite the complexity of the field and the humans ???within, these progressive changes with a focus on prioritising autonomy as the most important ethical consideration ??? lead to the betterment of consumers and the wellbeing of society as a whole.

> There is a widespread desire to base our study of mental disorder on objective symptoms alone and ideally to disregard subjective symptoms altogether

Psychiatry is unique in medicine in that there remains robust debate about the nature of, and existence of, the diseases it seeks to treat. This is due to the widespread variation of mental disorders secondary to the "subjectivity [of] symptoms" which can introduce barriers to the diagnostic process as well as in research methodologies to generate evidence-based management guidelines. Although shifts towards relying on "objective symptoms" provides an opportunity to reduce these barriers, this essay shall explore the implications of relying solely on objective symptoms from a historical, ethical, cultural and recovery-orientated perspective and the progress psychiatry is undergoing to incorporate trauma-informed and recovery-orientated approaches, shaped by subjective symptoms and experiences, to facilitate recovery.

Firstly, understandings of illness have been subject to centuries of historical and sociocultural influence and is inherently "subjective" due to the impact of consumers' individual lived experience. Ignorance of the former can lead to irrevocable harms such as the historical dehumanisation and enduring stigmatisation of those identifying as homosexual, previously considered a psychiatric disorder. It should be recognised that the concept of mental disorders have existed since ancient Mesopotomia (Parys, 2014) and have changed over time. This is reflected within the evolution of diagnostic frameworks as evidenced through the iterative editions of the DSM from psychoanalytic, to neurobiological, to reverse-nosological conceptual understandings of disease (Aftab, 2021). Diagnostic terms and labels for mental disorders can therefore never be fully objective as they are neither fixed nor universal and must be constantly scrutinised. 

Thus, from a principle-based ethics perspective, the diagnostic process must be conducted with care in recognition of the vast implications of its outcomes. At its worst, so-called "objective" criteria have been used to diagnose "sluggish schizophrenia" (Merskey, 1986), violating individuals' autonomy, to suppress political dissidents in the Soviet Union historically. Although mental illness can be diagnosed, in line with beneficent principles to further biopsychosocial management and unlock essential supports and resources, the duty of non-maleficence requires psychiatrists to consider the extensive ramifications of diagnosis and its subjective factors, particularly when misused within the legal, forensic and insurance settings which reduce consumers to labels and ignore the true extent of their psychological distress and functional impairment (RANZCP Position Statement 77).  Reflection upon these flaws and past errors supported by the psychiatric field not only reinforces the recommitment to ethics but also the need for psychiatrists to advocate upon those deemed mentally ill. Such an approach ultimately enables the psychiatric discipline to strive towards elimination of discrimination against our consumers (RANZCP Code of Ethics 11) by appreciating each consumer's subjective experience. 

Concomitantly, alternative experiences of illness can arise from different cultural contexts, introducing further subjectivity. For example, the First Nations people prioritise a holistic model of health, with greater consideration of familial and spiritual well-being. However, current practice guidelines and diagnostic systems such as the DSM-5-TR have been primarily developed from data collected in Western nations. Implementing this medical model of mental illness upon marginalised groups including the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD), Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Others (LGBTQ+) and First Nations populations not only ignores critical aspects of their concept of health, but also reinforces the power imbalances present from historical oppression eg. the Stolen Generation which manifest both in outcomes ie. increased rates of psychoses and suicides and also higher rates of discrimination, as reflected within the disproportional rates of involuntary assessments and incarceration of First Nations peoples. Reconciliation of the intergenerational trauma and lived experience of First Nations people thus highlights the need and appreciation for individualised care. Fortunately, this has been recognised by the incorporation of trauma-informed principles into practice (RANZCP Position Statement 100) and the introduction of peer support workers and Aboriginal Liaison Officers into multidisciplinary care represent a shift towards cultural sensitivity and holistic care (RANZCP Position Statement 50), in line with the recovery model. Thus, it is important to prioritise the integration of cultural safety, acknowledging the shortcomings of applying conventional models of care, which have shifted towards the reliance on objective criteria, to support the wellbeing of different cultural groups including Indigenous communities, their Elders and beyond.

Finally, public psychiatry is encompassed by schizophrenia-spectrum illnesses where lack of insight or anosognosia is common leading to barriers against shared decision making, regardless of the reliance upon objective symptoms to inform diagnoses. This can impair the cultivation of the therapeutic alliance which is recognised as a central tenet to the recovery process (RANZCP CPG for Mood Disorders). However, this may be set aside in the pursuit of biological management for objective symptoms as experienced in my early training rotations in inpatient roles. Such involuntary management compounded by restrictive environments, potential paranoia and perceptual disturbances is often highly traumatising and although can lead to short-term "improvement", more often impairs consumers' ability and motivation to participate in long-term preventative care and rehabilitation, perpetuating a vicious cycle of re-traumatisation when they become unwell. 

Adoption of Open Dialogue Model strategies (Sekkila et al, 1990s) by conducting team discussions and reflections in the presence of consumers and carers, provides opportunity to promote patient centred care and limited enhancement of autonomy within the involuntary setting, in line with the recovery model taking into account consumers' subjective symptoms. Participation in Balint groups has developed appreciation of the impact and harms of traditional paternalistic practice and reaffirms our roles as a collaborator and advocate (CANMEDS, 2015) to participating in and promoting shared-decision making. Affording consumers the dignity of risk (Ibrahim and Davis, 2014) in care decisions, can lead to development of insight, promoting empowerment and advocacy and enhance the therapeutic alliance which ultimately requires understanding of a consumer's subjective experience.

It is therefore important to recognise the complex and multi-faceted nature of psychiatry that extends beyond conventional medical models of assessment and management that have moved towards "objective criteria". Focusing only on the latter neglects the holistic picture and can damage the therapeutic alliance, disempower consumers and complicate the recovery process. Psychiatry has evolved in its shift towards patient-centred care as reflected within the implementation of trauma-informed principles, cultural safety and recovery-orientated strategies and demonstrates the requirement for ongoing examination and scrutinisation of its practice to provide benefit to its consumers and society as a whole.
