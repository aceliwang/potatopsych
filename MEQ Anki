## Autism Spectrum Disorder

### Overview
<!-- Type: cloze -->
- **Definition**: group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterised by *social defiicts* and *repetitive behaviours*
- **Age of onset**: typically prior to 3, however can become apparent later

### Assessment




- Principles
  - Individual- and family- centred approach
  - Holistic approach including personal, activity and environmental contexts
  - Promote their strengths
- Approach
  - (1) Comprehensive Needs Assessment: identify key strengths, challenges and needs
    - Medical evaluation should also be performed
    - Outcome determines management and whether diagnostic evaluation is required
    - Referral for supports does not require diagnostic evaluation to have occurred
  - (2) Diagnostic Evaluation
    - Determine whether ASD can explain the functional deficits or whether there are other modifiable factors
    - Stages: individual clinician and if inconclusive, consensus team evaluation
  - Essentially should be case-managed until outcome is determined
    - Allied health can contribute to either the Comprehensive Needs Assessment or the Consensus Team Diagnostic Evaluation
    - Psychologists can perform the individual clinicain diagnostic evaluation
    - Doctors can do everything except the consensus team evaluation because duh
  - Assessment should be conducted in all relevant settings however can include clinic
    - Community settings can be assessed via observation, recordings, interviewing the client or reports from other professionals
    - Telehealth should only be used to supplement, not replace face-to-face
  - Standardised assessments 
  - Repeated assessments to monitor and identify needs
- Content
  - PMHx
  - FHx + functioning
  - Languages at home
  - Developmental and educational
  - Strengths (activity-related and character)
  - Environmental facilitators and barriers
  - Observed and expressed support needs
  - Congenital and dysmporphic features
  - Vision and hearing
  - Biological investigations as required eg. chromosomal microarray

## Management of Tourette's Disease
<!-- Not complete -->

- Pharmacotherapy
  - (1) Commence clonidine 50mcg once daily
  - (2) Trial aripiprazole, risperidone or haloperidol
- Psychosocial
  - Cognitive behavioural interventions for tics with **habit reversal training**
  - CBT with **exposure-response prevention**

# Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry

## Cognition Testing

### Frontal Lobe
<!-- Type: cloze -->

- **Screens for**: frontotemporal dementia, frontal lobe dysfunction associated with SCZ, executive dysfunction in Parkinson's or substance dependence
- **Distinguishes between**: frontotemporal dementia vs Alzheimer's
- **Tests**: Frontal Assessment Battery (similarities, lexical fluency, Luria test, Go-No-Go, conflicting instructions, environmental autonomy), trail-making test
- Similarities
  - Compare two objects, should be the same category
  - Tests abstract reasoning (frontal)
- Lexical fluency
  - As many words beginning with S
  - Tests ability to navigate non-routine situations
  - Significant impairments demonstrate left frontal lobe dysfunction
- Luria test
  - Fist, edge, palm. Demonstrate, do together and then patient does alone
  - Tests motor programming (temporal organisation, maintenance, sequencing, attention and execution)
- Conflicting instructions
  - Tap twice when I tap once, tap once when I tap twice
  - Tests set switching similar to Stroop
- Go-No-Go
  - Tap once when I tap once, do not tap when I tap twice
  - Tests inhibitory control particularly after Conflicting Instructions
- Environmental autonomy, grasp reflex
  - "Do not take my hands"
  - Tests reliance on environmental cues and inhibition over primitive reflexes
- Trail-making test
  - Alternate A-1-B-2 etc.
  - Tests cognitive flexibility with dorsolateral prefrontal context

### Temporal Lobe

- Delayed-recall
  - Tests short-term memory and hippocampus
- Orientation
  - Tests memory and hippocampus
- Naming animals
  - Tests semantic memory

### Parietal Lobe

- Clock-drawing test
  - Tests visuospatial perception in right parietal lobe
  - Tests execution function
- Cube drawing test
  - Tests visuospatial perception in right parietal lobe
- Gerstmann's syndrome
  - Finger agnosia
  - Acalculia: inability to calculate
  - Agraphia: inability to write
  - Left-right disorientation


## Psychopharmacology in Medical Comorbidities

### Cardiac Disease

- Considerations: psychotropics can affect heart rate, blood pressure, QTc, increase arrhythmias


### Atrial Fibrillation

### HIV
<!-- Incomplete -->

- Considerations
  - Drug interactions with antiretrovirals
  - Avoid typicaly antipsychotics due to proclivity for EPSEs
    - Due to HIV invasion into basal ganglia 
  - HIV progression can increase QT interval
  - Additive metabolic effects with antipsychotics
  - Close monitoring required with clozapine due to agranulocytosis
  - Avoid MAOIs as not recommended
  - Citalopram can be used for interferon-alpha-induced depression for co-infected HCV however not prophylactic
    - Interferon-alpha is also being phased out for HCV
- Antipsychotic choice: aripiprazole, quetiapine ∵ lower risk of EPSE
- Antidepressant choice: escitalopram, citalopram ∵ lower risk of drug interactions, however monitor QTc
- Mood-stabiliser choice:
