# Opioid Dependence

## Overview
- Opioid overdose is lethal
- Opioid withdrawal is unpleasant but not lethal

## Overdose
- **Management**: naloxone IM. Repeated administration may be required.

## Withdrawal and Detoxification
- Can use methadone or buprenoprhine for either

## Relapse Prevention
- Opioid substitution therapy
  - Minimum of 12 months
  - Start wih supervised dosing which can be stretched depending on stability
  - Monitor stability with UDS, MSE and collateral

## Assessing Suitability
- Current opiate and other drug use
- Time of last use
- Other medications

## Methadone
- **Mechanism of action**: full opioid agonist
- **Formulations**: oral liquid only. Typically 5mg/mL.

## Buprenorphine
- **Mechanism of action**: partial opioid agonist
- **Formulations**:
  - Oral sublingual film + naloxone: Suboxone 2mg/0.5mg or 8mg/2mg
  - Oral tablet: Subutex
  - Subcutaneous depot (weekly or monthly): Buvidal, Sublocade
- Concept of Suboxone: diversion and injection leads to inactivation of buprenorphine due to presence of naloxone
- **Commencement**: start with mild-moderate opioid withdrawal (sweating, dilated pupils) as starting earlier is likely to precipitate withdrawal due to buprenoprhine's affinity to opioid receptors 

## Choice of methadone vs buprenorphine
- Concern of administration: buprenorphine has depots or second-daily administration
- Concern of withdrawal: buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal
- Speed of uptitration: buprenorphine is faster to get to therapeutic dosing
- Adherence: buprenorphine has depot formulation
- Concern of overdose: buprenorphine is safer
- Concern of stigma: methadone has more stigma
- Termination of therapy: easier to taper buprenorphine
- Physical issues
  - Methadone increases QTc
  - Cannot use naloxone in liver failure (suboxone)
  - Increased drug interactions with methadone
- Methadone has higher sedation, may be preferred in certain patients

## Benefits of OST
- Manages withdrawal
- Harm reduction
  - Reduces illicit usage
  - Decrease further increase
