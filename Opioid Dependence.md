# Opioid Dependence

## Overview
- Opioid overdose is lethal
- Opioid withdrawal is unpleasant but not lethal

## Overdose
- **Manifestations**: unconscious, pinpoint pupils, bradypnoea, clammy, cyanosed  
- **Management**: naloxone IM 400 microg or intranasal 2mg. Repeated administration may be required.
  - Intranasal obviously has longer time of onset

## Withdrawal and Detoxification
- Heroin withdrawal: starts after 4-6 hrs, peaks at 32-72 hr, symptoms subside after 5 days
- Methadone withdrawal: starts after 4-6 days, symptoms subside after 10-12 days
- Buprenorphine withdrawal: lasts for 10 days
- Assessment: COWS (11 symptoms, out of 4-5 each)
  - Autonomic: tachycardia, sweating, gooseflesh skin
  - Psych: restlessness, anxiety or irritability
  - Neuro: tremor, yawning, pinpoint pupils, bone or joint aches
  - Other: GI upset, runny nose/tearing
  - 5-12 mild, 13-24 moderate, 25-36 moderately severe, 36+ severe. Max 48.
- Can use methadone or buprenoprhine for either

## Relapse Prevention
- Opioid substitution therapy
  - Minimum of 12 months
  - Start wih supervised dosing which can be stretched depending on stability
  - Monitor stability with UDS, MSE and collateral. Can then switch to takeaways.
  - Start with safe dosages (overdose kills)
- Starting OST
  - Supervision for a few months
  - Max takeaways for 7 days
- Takeaway management
  - Must consider suitability: presence of kids, ability to manage takeaways

## Assessing Suitability
- Current opiate and other drug use. Amount, frequency, route, source.
- Time of last use, state of withdrawal
- Medical comorbidities ie. contraindications. Other medications.
- Previous OST and experiences

## Dosing
- Difficult to determine due to tolerance. Tolerance can drop within 3 days of abstinence.
- Start low, go slow. Deaths are common during initiation.
- When is therapeutic dose reached: nil further withdrawal + nil further opiate use + nil excess sedation
- Starting requires evidence of use ie. UDS and active withdrawal

## Methadone
- **Mechanism of action**: full opioid agonist
- **Formulations**: oral liquid only. Typically 5mg/mL.
- **Dosing in outpatient**: start at 10mg, increase by 5-10mg each week. Therapeutic dose is 60-120mg.
  - Monitor ECG for QTc (annually for healthy cardiac status)
  - Can increase by 5-10mg every 3-4 days as an inpatient
- Dosing factors: age, cocaine use (cocaine decreases methadone levels), hepatic and renal dysfunction
- Omit if sedated or intoxicated with other depressants

## Buprenorphine
- **Mechanism of action**: partial opioid agonist, high affinity, low potency
- **Formulations**:
  - Oral sublingual film + naloxone: Suboxone 2mg/0.5mg or 8mg/2mg
  - Oral tablet: Subutex
  - Subcutaneous depot (weekly or monthly): Buvidal, Sublocade
- Concept of Suboxone: diversion and injection leads to inactivation of buprenorphine due to presence of naloxone
- **Commencement**: start with mild-moderate opioid withdrawal (sweating, dilated pupils) as starting earlier is likely to precipitate withdrawal due to buprenoprhine's affinity to opioid receptors 
- **Sublingual dosing**: 2-32mg daily
  - Active withdrawal without risk factors: start 8mg
  - No withdrawal and without risk factors: start 4mg
  - Risk factors present: start 2-4mg (if unsure about dependence, medical condition, polydrug misuse)
- **Monitoring**: buprenorphine does not always show up in UDS, monitor LFTs 

## Choice of methadone vs buprenorphine
- Concern of administration: buprenorphine has depots or second-daily administration
- Concern of withdrawal: buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal
- Speed of uptitration: buprenorphine is faster to get to therapeutic dosing (days vs methadone's weeks)
- Adherence: buprenorphine has depot formulation
- Concern of overdose: buprenorphine is safer
- Concern of stigma: methadone has more stigma
- Termination of therapy: easier to taper buprenorphine
- Physical issues
  - Methadone increases QTc, more likely to cause respiratory depression
  - Cannot use naloxone in liver failure (suboxone)
  - Increased drug interactions with methadone (SSRIs, erythromycin, HIV medications, antiepileptics)
- Concern if pregnant: methadone is easier to manage, buprenorphine should not be started
- Concern of diversion: oral methadone is harder to divert than sublingual buprenorphine. Mitigated by injection.
- Methadone has higher sedation, may be preferred in certain patients
- Methadone appears to be easier to adhere to

## Benefits of OST
- Manages withdrawal
- Harm reduction
  - Reduces illicit usage
  - Stabilise opioid usage
  - Decrease risk of injecting ie. BBV, etc.

## Methadone to buprenorphine
- Precipitated withdrawal tends to occur but can be minimised
- Reduce methadone to < 40mg daily dose.
  - Psychoeducate regarding precipitated withdrawal
  - Abrupt cessation of methadone.
  - Commence buprenorphine at least 24 hrs after, targeting withdrawal from methadone.
  - Start at 4mg. 2mg is typically ineffective, 8mg is more likely to precipitate withdrawal.
- If methadone cannot be decreased to < 40mg, definitely requires admission to specialist D&A.

## Special Situations
- Patient is on PCA
- Patient requires pain control
  - Use non-opiate analgesia
  - If above not enough, add another non-methadone opiate
  - Buprenorphine may be displacing additional opioids, thus requiring higher doses
- Pregnancy
  - Avoid detox in first trimester due to increased risks of abortion and third trimester due to pre-term delivery
  - Methadone dosages may need to be increased due to increased metabolism
  - Attempt to maintain on stable dose and to continue regular agent (avoid suboxone)
  - Neonates are likely to experience NAS: manage by paediatrics
  - Breastfeeding reduces NAS although does not prevent. Should be tapered to avoid NAS.

## Continuing Opiate Therapy as an Inpatient
- Confirm pharmacy
- Confirm last dosage
- Confirm prescription
- Check take-aways. Destroy take-aways.

## Symptomatic Management
- Use whilst opiate substution is being considered or patient is drowsy
- Diarrhoea: loperamide 4mg
- Nausea and vomiting: metoclopramide 10mg TDS
- Agitation, anxiety: diazepam 5-10mg

## Psychotropic Considerations
- Depression is common comorbidly
- Avoid TCAs due to QTc
- Avoid sedating psychotropics if possible eg. olanzapine
- Preference sertraline as SSRI due to limited interactions

## Terminating Substitution Therapy

- Methadone: over up to 3 months in the community, 2-3 weeks as an inpatient. Drop by 5-10mg every week or fortnight until the end (maybe decrease down to 1-2mg every week). As per patient preference. Consider relapse into opiate use.
- Buprenorphine: up to multiple weeks in the community, 1-2 weeks as an inpatient. Taper depends on stabilised dose.
- Concerns are usage after detoxification ie. loss of tolerance, leading to overdose and death
