## Tourette's Syndrome

- Demographics
  - M > F
  - Childhood onset with peak severity in adolescence
  - High comorbidity of ADHD and OCD
- Clinical manifestations
  - Motor then vocal tics
  - "Premonitory sensation" which is relieved by performing the tic
- Diagnosis
  - Recurrent tics over more than 1 year
- Management
  - (1st) non-pharmacological
    - Psychoeducation + coping strategies
    - Identify and address triggers
    - Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics + habit reversal training
      - CBIT addresses tics sequentially
    - Less evidence for exposure and response prevention
      - ERP targets all tics at the same time
  - (2nd) pharmacological if severe, debilitating or self-injurious tics
    - Medications decrease frequency and severity however rarely achieves complete suppression
    - Manage comorbid ADHD and OCD
    - Clonidine (for 5yo+): start at 50mcg daily, increase by 50mcg every 3 days up to 300 mcg (in 4 divided doses)
      - First-line. Less effective but safer. More useful in comorbd ADHD
      - Monitor BP and sedation
    - Antipsychotics eg. risperidone or aripiprazole. Ziprasidone or haloperidol also have limited evidence
      - Psychoeducation regarding side effects particularly long-term consequences including TD, prolactin issues, metabolic side effects
      - Risperidone (for 7yo+) 0.25 to 0.5mg, increase by 0.5mg every 5 days until 3mg (in 2 divided doses)
      - Aripiprazole or haloperidol
  - (3rd) neuromodulation eg. deep brain stimulation
- Prognosis
  - Most improve significantly in adulthood
  - Minority will continue with significant symptoms. Can continue medications if required.
