# Factitious Disorder

Epidemiology, aetiology (biopsychosocial, cultural), symptomatology, course, assessment, management (biopsychosocial, cultural), psychiatric and medical comorbidities, differential diagnoses.

## Definition
- Intentional production of symptoms or feigning of diseases for primary gain

## Epidemiology

- Two types
  - Acute: females typically in medical professions aged between 20-40
  - Chronic (Munchausen): single estranged middle-aged males
- If by proxy, almost always is the mother inducing symptoms in a child


## Symptomatology

- Conscious self-production of physical and/or psychological symptoms for the purposes of primary gain

## Prognosis

- Considerable morbidity and mortality due to self-injurious behaviours
- Insight is poor, precluding treatment
- Very few seek treatment for factitious disorder
- Majority will transfer medical care elsewhere to continue


## Assessment

- Direct evidence: eg. evidence for confirmation of induction of symptoms is found
- Indirect evidence
  - Exclusion of medical diagnosis
  - Severe Axis II disorder

## Differential Diagnoses

- Organic medical illness

## Management

- Involvement of hospital administration and legal department / MDO
- Consult ethics department from hospital
- Maintain confidentiality to the extent of the law
- Joint review by attending medical officer and consulting pscyhiatrist
  - Patient is informed they are contributing to their illness
  - Advised that the behaviour must reflect higher degree of emotional distress and difficulty in communicating needs
  - Offer therapeutic assistance
