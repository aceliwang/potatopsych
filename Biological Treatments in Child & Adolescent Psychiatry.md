## Principles of Prescription in C&A
- Most medications will be off-label due to not being tested in children
- Medications are symptomatic as diagnosis is difficult in children
- Start low, go slow
  - Takes longer for onset of effects in children
- True childhood-onset illness is severe and often requires combination therapy
  - As always, attempt monotherapy if possible
- One medication change at a time. If introducing something new, try removing something else that isn't working.
- Symptoms are typically different across different settings. Behaviour across all settings should be assessed.
- Educate early and well due to likely life-long requirements for medication. Educate family as well.

## Typical Arsenal of Medications

- Fluoxetine
- Sertraline
- Fluovoxamine
- Risperidone
- Aripiprazole
- Clonidine

## Targeting Depression
- Assessment
  - Comprehensive assessment
  - Exclude differentials: bipolar affective disorder, organic disorders, medication-related effects
  - Consider comorbidities
  - Consider contraindications
  - Risk assessment
  - Psychoeducation and informed consent of any medications
    - Expected onset
    - Potential adverse effects
    - Discontinuation syndrome
  - Safety planning
    - Responsible adults should be managing medications
- Medications vs psychotherapy
  - Mild: psychotherapy only
  - Moderate to severe: psychotherapy +/- antidepressant medications
    - Antidepressant monotherapy can be considered if psychotherapy is not possible or if depression is considered severe
    - Unclear whether monotherapy (ADT vs psychotherapy) or combination has any clear superiority
    - CBT may decrease suicidality effects of ADT
    - Limited evidence combination > antidepressant
    - Conclusion IMHO: to treat depression, use one or the other (ADT vs psychotherapy), however what's the harm in both
- Medication choices
  - SSRIs
    - Safe enough for depression in young people
    - Modest effects in meta-analyses, likely high placebo response rates (NNT=10)
    - Choice medications
      - Fluoxetine
        - Largest amount of evidence, FDA approved for childen, although not in Australia
        - Start at 10mg and increase to 20mg (minimum effective dose) after 7 days
        - Reserve higher doses (40-60mg) if severe illness or large body size
    - Others: sertraline (start at 25-50mg, titrate up to 50-200mg), escitalopram (start at 5-10mg, titrate up to 10-20mg). These may require BD dosing due to shorter half-lives.
    - Add psychotherapy if SSRI alone is not effective
  - Treatment resistance ie. ongoing depression despite SSRI + psychological therapy
    - Consider (switch to alternate SSRI or venlafaxine) + CBT
      - Alternate SSRI is as effective as venlafaxine with lesser side effects
    - Augment with SGA or lithium if partial response noted
    - Consider switch to mirtazapine, especially if sedation is required.
    - Escalate to rTMS, ECT or ketamine in older children
  - NICE suggests avoiding paroxetine (increased suicidality), venlafaxine (poor discontinuation syndrome), TCAs (overdose safety) or St John's Wort. Omega-3 has no evidence for depression in young people or adults.
- After prescribing
  - Monitor for adverse effects weekly for first four weeks
    - Typically well-tolerated
    - Notable risks of suicidality (2%, but not completed suicides) and manic switch (6% albeit unclear cause noting context of activation syndrome)
      - Risk of suicide is a lot higher in untreated depression
  - Monitor for efficacy after four weeks of therapeutic dosing
    - If poor efficacy: re-assess diagnoses and/or treatment adherence. Increase dose if nil other factors. Reassess in 4 weeks.
    - If poorly tolerated: reduce dose to highest tolerated dose
    - If no response after 8 weeks of maximum recommended dose or highest tolerance dose, proceed down above algorithm
  - If effective, continue medications for minimum 6 to 12 months
    - Increased length of prophylaxis if recurrent or chronic depression
  - Discontinue after above maintenance phase in periods of low-stress

## Targeting Bipolar
- Assessment
  - Use structured instrument assessment ie. mood and/or sleep diaries to monitor symptoms prospectively
  - Early psychoeducation to improve adherence and to reduce relapse
  - Baseline can be measured for mania (YMRS), depression (CDRS) and functional impairment (CGI-BD)
  - Medications for bipolar have long-term adverse outcomes. Monitor baseline weight, height, vitals, ECG. Also obtain baseline bloods and exclude organicity.
- Medication options
  - First-line SGA. Treatment resistance ie. two failures should prompt use of mood-stabilisers
  - SGA has better efficacy in the short-term compared to mood-stabilisers
  - Note SGA has metabolic effects (difficult to assess due to normal development)
  - Lithium
    - Difficult to monitor with kids and blood tests
    - BD dosing required due to fast clearance
    - Takes time to work, evidence is all over the place
  - Valproate
    - Avoid in girls due to teratogenecity
    - Nil significant diffeerences in YMRS compared to placebo at 4 weeks
  - Olanzapine 5-20mg: good effect compared to placebo within 3 weeks with increased metabolic adverse effects
  - Risperidone 0.5-2.5mg: TEAM study showed risperidone worked better than mood-stabilisers although definitions of mania were broarder. Better than placebo in reducing YMRS with increased sleepiness, fatigue and weight gain.
  - Quetiapine up to 400mg: signficantly better than placebo with increased sedation and weight gain. Improves the response of valproate and probably works as well as valproate by itself.
  - Aripiprazole 10mg: also better than placebo however increased EPSE at higher doses. Note increased weight gain as well in kids.
  - Asenapine 2.5 to 10mg BD: works however too many side effects (weight gain, metabolic changes, sedation, paraesthesia, oral hypoaesthesia)
- Bipolar depression
  - Quetiapine up to 300mg: evidence isn't great in kids with large RCTs not showing effectiveness
  - Olanzapine + fluoxetine: positive results, considered first-line, using doses of 5/20mg or 10/40mg. Noted metabolic effects.
  - Lurasidone 20-80mg: nil good evidence in children, although evidence can be generalised from adults
  - Lamotrigine: not recommended due to lack of evidence particularly in acute depression
- After prescribing
  - Monitor symptoms
  - Monitor weight and height every visit. 
  - Monitor metabolic side effects at 3 months, then every 6 months. Psychoeducation about lifestyle measures.
  - Wait for up to 4-5 weeks. Switch if no response at 2 weeks, excluding non-compliance.
  - Maintenance management is same as in adults as per Maudlseys
    - Attempt lithium earlier on due to its evidence (either monotherapy or adjunct to successful SGA)
- Things to note
  - Essentially working without evidence due to minimal bipolar illness in C&A
  - Antidepressants should only be used in bipolar depression with an antimanic agent on board
    - As per adult guidelines: (olanzapine + fluoxetine) OR quetiapine OR lurasidone
  - Stimulants may be safe in comorbid ADHD and BPAD, just be cautious
  - Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder was introduced to lower rates of BPAD. Essentially captures the severely irritable children. Lithium does not work. Consider SSRIs and better parenting.
  - Psychotherapy can assist in preventing depression relapse
  - rTMS is experimental, not enough evidence to proceed

## Targeting Psychosis
- Assessment
  - SCZ is rare in children, increases in adolescence
  - Early-onset schizophrenia-spectrum (EOSS) is typically chronic and requiring lifelong antipsychotics
- Medication choices
  - Avoid FGAs due to tardive dyskinesia
  - Most SGAs have evidence in EOSS except for ziprasidone (inferior) and asenapine (unclear)
  - Side effects tend to be worse in children compared to adults (including clozapine specific effects)
  - Due to lifelong treatment, metabolic markers and baselines should be obtained for ongoing monitoriong

## Targeting Anxiety
- Assessment
  - Most common psychiatric disorder in children
  - Avoidance may manifest as irritability and anger. Exclude other disorders due to the murkiness of basis of symptoms. Exclude organicity particularly anti-asthma medications, steroids, caffeine etc. 
  - Note context of developmental age, anxiety can improve over time with development of prefrontal cortex and executive function
  - Chronic stress/anxiety however can predispose to future functional impairment and preclude important experiences for development. Young people with anxiety are 3x more likely to have anxiety as an adult.
- Management approach
  - Multimodal treatment: psychoeducation, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy
  - Psychotropics should be reserved to moderate-severe symptoms or used to facilitate psychotherapy
    - SSRIs
      - SSRI + CBT > SSRI alone = CBT alone
      - Effects should emerge by week 6-8
      - Fluoxetine and escitalopram most tolerable
    - SNRIs are effective but less tolerated compared to SSRIs
    - Avoid BZDs and TCAs. BZDs can cause paradoxical disinhibition. Reserve for rapid sedation.
- After prescribing
  - Start low, go slow, monitor side effects (likely to be similar to anxiety symptoms)
  - Increase SSRIs after 1 week and SNRIs after 2 weeks when side effects are minimal
  - Sertraline: start at 12.5-25mg, aim for 25-200mg
  - Fluoxetine: start at 5-10mg, aim for 10-60mg
  - If not effective, reconsider diagnosis and compliance
  - Things to throw at the patient if not working: add CBT, switch medications, combine medications.
  - Maintain for at least 1 year with regular monitoring before deprescribing.
- Notes
  - In preschoolers, focus on psychotherapy

## Targeting OCD and BDD

- Assessment
  - Screen for BDD in suicide attempters and self-harmers
- Management approach for OCD and BDD
  - Algorithm is similar to adults
  - CBT is effective for both, however is typically combined with medications
  - Treatment 
- Medication choices for OCD
  - SSRIs: sertraline, fluoxetine or fluvoxamine. Mood effects should show within 2 weeks although OCD/BDD symptoms may only shift in weeks to months
  - Evidence for clomipramine in young people is limited
- Medication choices for BDD
  - Nil medications licensed. Fluoxetine can help.
  - Avoid antipsychotics even if delusional intensity.
