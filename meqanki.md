	- MDT w/ dietitian
- Ax:
	- Initial → daily (2/52)
		- Vital signs, anthropometry
		- EUC, CMP, LFT, micronutrients (per dietitian)
		- ECG
	- ± Sx/complications:
		- Neuropsych: Sensory Δ, delirium (1st)
		- Hyperglycaemia → polyuria
		- Mm weakness (incl. heart, diaphragm, peristalsis)
		- End-organ hypoxia
		- Arrhythmia
		- Cardiac arrest
	- ± risk Fx: Rapid ↓ BW, fasting >5/7, % carb refeeding

	- Prophylactic: 
		- Thiamine, PO3-, multivitamin
		- Gradual ↑ kcal (↓ carb, ↑ protein vs. rebound ↓ BGL)
		- Electrolyte/micronutrient replacement vs. Ix/dietetics
	- Feeding:
		- Moderate start(1500 kcal) → gradual ↑ → goal intake
			- ⨂ absolute guidelines
		- 40% protein
		- Least invasive route (NG if ↑ risk)
		- Only food provided
		- ⨂ excess fluid intake (vs. ↑↓ electrolytes)

- **Definition**: group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterised by *social defiicts* and *repetitive behaviours*
- **Age of onset**: typically prior to 3, however can become apparent later
### Assessment <!-- id:ae291127-16be-4cd0-8e0a-4dc26dbe9df2 -->
- Principles
  - Individual- and family- centred approach
  - Holistic approach including personal, activity and environmental contexts
  - Promote their strengths
- Approach
  - (1) Comprehensive Needs Assessment: identify key strengths, challenges and needs
    - Medical evaluation should also be performed
    - Outcome determines management and whether diagnostic evaluation is required
    - Referral for supports does not require diagnostic evaluation to have occurred
  - (2) Diagnostic Evaluation
    - Determine whether ASD can explain the functional deficits or whether there are other modifiable factors
    - Stages: individual clinician and if inconclusive, consensus team evaluation
  - Essentially should be case-managed until outcome is determined
    - Allied health can contribute to either the Comprehensive Needs Assessment or the Consensus Team Diagnostic Evaluation
    - Psychologists can perform the individual clinicain diagnostic evaluation
    - Doctors can do everything except the consensus team evaluation because duh
  - Assessment should be conducted in all relevant settings however can include clinic
    - Community settings can be assessed via observation, recordings, interviewing the client or reports from other professionals
    - Telehealth should only be used to supplement, not replace face-to-face
  - Standardised assessments 
  - Repeated assessments to monitor and identify needs
- Content
  - PMHx
  - FHx + functioning
  - Languages at home
  - Developmental and educational
  - Strengths (activity-related and character)
  - Environmental facilitators and barriers
  - Observed and expressed support needs
  - Congenital and dysmporphic features

		- Formulation (succinct summary, relevant findings, conclusions/reasoning, Mx 		options).
	- Clarify: 
		- Relevant content,
		- Basis for Mx
		- ? what’s missing (e.g. story ⨂ add up, cognitive Ax)
	- Assess: 
		- Details of Ax (adequacy vs. Mx/MHA/risk/confidence)
		- ?disagree (e.g. stem vs. likely Dx)
		- Reg’s thinking (e.g. anxiety, inexperience) → support (?in 	person)

### Complaint Management

- Managing complaint:
	- Clarify details/specifics of complaint
	- Pt care:

		- Consider NOK contact vs. risk Ax
		- Check available collateral from/available formal/clinical supports
		- Ensure suggested Mx documented in case of re-presentation
		- ± consult w/ relevant services (re further Mx/f/u)
	- Consider QI processes as an outcome:
		- Documentation
		- Communication
		- Adherence to policy/procedure
		- Reflective practice
- Procedure:
	- Basic:
		- ‘Use hospital protocols to respond’ e.g. PLO, medicolegal dept
		- Likely needs written response from consultant/clin. dir. 
	- Detail:
		- Complainant:
			- Identity protected (where appropriate/feasible), can be anonymous
			- ⨂ detriment
		- Communication:
			- Prompt response
			- Given contact for complaint manager
		- Management:
			- @ all staff levels → ideally resolved @ front line
				- Accept, early apology, acknowledgement, give info
				- Register w/ incident management
				- Requests manager → must refer
			- ⨂ all complaints → investigation
			- → escalation:
				- Serious/complicated/above pay grade
				- Re colleague
				- Requested by complainant
				- Needs external reporting
				Unreasonable complainant conduct (e.g. persistence, 					demands, conduct, ⨂ cooperative, argumentative)  → 					- additional support from org
			- Ax:
				- Nature/seriousness of complaint → appropriate area/agency
					- → consent to disclose externally
				- Risk Ax
					- Pt safety
					- Org operations/legal/financial/reputation
			- Mx:
				- Variable: 
					- Apology & explanation
					- Further meeting/info
					- Referral
					- Investigation (like RCA) → ‘reasonable limits’
				- Liaison:
					- Single contact person → regular updates
					- Complicated → discuss process
			- Outcomes:
				- Apology 
				- F2F meeting
				- Waiving fees
				- QI
				- ± explanation (result, reasons for decision, options for review)
				- NFA
		- Documentation:
			- Complaint records kept by service → audit/QI
		- ± Pathways:
			- → reveals pt incident → open disclosure
			- → alleged staff misconduct → misconduct Mx
			- → alleges corrupt conduct → ICAC
			- Etc
- Complaint re clinician (similar to managing misconduct):
	- May require external investigators
		- Decision maker ⨂ involved in investigation
	- Clinician informed once safe & appropriate: Process, support.
	- Risk can → alternative work, suspension
	- Any belief re notifiable conduct → AHPRA (risk of harm, impairment, misconduct)
	- All evidence before → clinician interview
	- Findings: Briginshaw standard
		- Adverse findings → clinician right of reply
		- Proposed discipline/remedy → clinician right of reply
- Complaint re reg:
	- ‘Gain their perspective’
	- Written response → offer to help write
	- As above for reg problem/mistake (likely ⨂ e.g. coronial)

### Bullying and Discrimination Approach
- Definitions: Legislation against these

	- Discrimination: ‘less favourable’ treatment than another ‘on the basis of protected 	attributes’
		- Incl. race, gender, orientation, marital/domestic status, disability, age.
	- Harassment: Targeted ‘intrusive behaviours’ that ‘intimidate, offend or humiliate’.
	- Sexual harassment: ‘Unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature’ → ‘intimidate, offend or 	humiliate’.
- Management:
	- Process: Usually manager, sometimes external (severe, complicated, bias)
		- Ax: 
			- ? definitions as above or lesser ( → grievance Mx)
			- Risk
		- Complainant: 
			- Right & responsibility to confidentiality.
			- Can request NFA → ? reprisals
		- Temporary Mx:
			- Manage workplace/arrangements (incl. ? suspension)
			- ↑ supervision
		- Communication:
			- Complainant & subject given info, rights, responsibilities, referral info

### Report Writing
- Clarify:

	- Addressee
	- Request/expectations
- Discuss:
	- Clinical vs. legal roles
	- Obligations (to pt, to court, etc.)
	- Factual vs. expert opinion (vs. speculation)
	- Confidentiality (vs. report, subpoena, evidence)
- Ethics:
	- Consent/confidentiality (esp. if for court)
	- Dual agency
	- Resources/equity
	- Effects on therapeutic engagement, transference
- Mx:
	- Seek supervision, peer r/v
	- D/w indemnifier, hospital legal, clin dir
	- ? refer → more appropriate assessor, legal aid
