# Specialised Cognitive Testing

- B1.1.2 Specialised cognitive testing (IDK)

## Screening Tools
- Simple checkboxe tools to determine if possible cognitive impairment
- Despite being a screening tool, may not be very sensitive
- **Advantages**: easy to administer and monitor clinical course

### Mini Mental State Examination
- Components
  - Orientation: time, place
  - Memory: three objects (short-term recall)
  - Attention: serial 7s
  - Language: naming objects, repeating sentence, following 3-stage commands, writing a sentence
  - Visuospatial: intersecting pentagons
- Notable domains not tested
  - Executive function
- Interpretation
  - 0-10: severe cognitive impairment
  - 11-20: moderate impairment
  - 21-26: mild impairment
  - 27-30: quetionable impairment or intact function
- Well studied, high amounts of research
- Copyrght laws technically preclude usage

### Montreal Cognitive Assessment
- Comparison: more domains than MMSE
- Components
  - Visuospatial: trail test, clock-drawing
  - 


### RUDAS


## Frontal Battery

## After the Screening Tool

When more detailed analysis is required, formal neuropsychological assessment of each cognitive domain is recommended:
- Executive function
- Memory and learning
- Complex attention
- Perceptual-motor
- Language
- Social cognition
