# WBA - Delirium

# Case



# Delirium

- **Causes**
  - Drugs (polypharmacy/side-effects/withdrawal/intoxication)
    - Any centrally acting substances
    - Anticholinergics in particular
  - Infections
  - Surgery
  - Constipation
  - Urinary retention
  - Sleep deprivation
- **Risk factors**
  - Brain vulnerabilities: age, dementia and mild-cognitive impairment, long-term alcohol usage
  - Poor inputs ie. vision and hearing
- **Clinical manifestations**
  - Onset: acute, fluctuating course
  - Hyperactive: agitated, increased sympathetic activity, psychosis
  - Hypoactive: increased sleeping, decreased arousal
  - Mixed: fluctuating between above
- **DSM-5 criteria**
  - Disturbance in attention (focus) and awareness (reduced environmental stimuli)
  - Acute onset, different to baseline
  - Additional disturbed cognition (memory, disorientation, language, visuospatial ability or perception)
  - Cause: must be evidence of a physical cause
  - Exclusions: not explained by coma or other known neurocognitive disorder
- **Tests**
  - CAM
  - 4AT
- **Management**
  - Treat the underlying cause
    - ADEs: review medications for cessation (anything centrally acting, anticholinergics)
    - Constipation: bowel chart, laxatives
    - Urinary retention: in/out catheters
    - Avoid lines where possible
    - Withdrawal: CIWA, COWS
  - Non-pharmacological and prevention
    - Optimise sleep (nil evidence for melatonin, avoid BZDs)
    - Provide orientation eg. windows, family members
    - Manage sensory inputs eg. hearing aids, vision
    - Reduce lines and catheters
    - 1:1 nursing special
  - If hyperactive and at risk of aggression, can use antipsychotics. **WHO CONSENTS?**
    - Haloperidol 0.5-1mg PO **do these doses actually do anything??????**
    - Olanzapine 1.25-5mg PO (beware sedation)
    - Risperidone 0.5-1mg PO (beware EPSE and hypotension)
    - Quetiapine 25mg PO (particularly in PD or DLB, beware sedation and hypotension)
    - Escalate to haloperidol 0.5-1mg IM or olanzapine 2.5-5mg IM
    - eTG says: wait for 30-60 mins for onset. Aim single dose only. Regular courses for 2-3 days max. Cease in case antipsychotics are causing the delirium. Avoid PRN.
    - Maudsley says: use one drug at a time, small doses regularly compared to large doses less regularly. Maintain at effective dose for 7-10 days after symptoms resolve.
      - Risperidone and olanzapine have poorer response rates in the elderly
      - Risperidone 0.5mg BD with PRN (max 4mg/day)
      - Quetiapine 12.5-50mg BD (max 200mg/day)
      - Olanzapine 2.5-5mg once daily (max 20mg/day)
    - Avoid BZDs due to sedation, respiratory depression and paradoxical excitement unless treating withdrawal. Typically prolongs and worsens delirium.
    - Pharmacological prophylaxis is contentious
- **Differentials**
  - Dementia
  - Psychosis
- **Complications**
  - Increases mortality and length of stay
  - Increases risk of long-term institutional placement
- **Prognosis**
  - 60% have persistent cognitive impairment
  - 50% do not recover prior to discharge
  - 1 year mortality rate in elderly: 35-40%
  - 3x more likely to develop dementia

# Delirium vs Acute Encephalopathy

- Delirium is technically the syndrome, encephalopathy the pathology
- Acute encephalopathy
  - Rapidly developing pathobiological process in the brain (within 4 weeks)
  - Manifests clinically as subsyndromal delirium (ie. does not meet DSM-5 criteria), DSM-5 delirium or coma
  - However, acute encephalopathy should not be diagnosed by bedside assessment. Note that delirium as per DSM-5 also states that an underlying physiological cause should be present.
  - Can also have seizures or EPS
- Terms such as altered mental status, acute brain failure, acute confusional state should not be used
