## MEQ 1
Olivia is a 29-year-old, married mother of three children aged twelve months to eight years. She experienced significant sexual abuse in her childhood. Olivia has just been discharged to the local community mental health team at which you work, following a three-month admission to a nearby acute psychiatric inpatient unit. Prior to admission Olivia became depressed after hearing that her brother had been found guilty of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. She developed flashbacks and nightmares of her own experiences of abuse, and had frequent panic attacks. She was found by her oldest child with a cord around her neck, and admitted to hospital. Her hospital admission was characterised by recurrent episodes of self-harm including lacerating her arms and tying cords around her neck. She was treated with sodium valproate, paroxetine and diazepam. Olivia was eventually discharged on these medications still symptomatic.

### MEQ 1.1 Discuss the immediate and longer term psychiatric interventions you would suggest for Olivia's previous sexual abuse. Please give reasons for your choices. (7 marks)

> Structure:
> - Immediate
> - Longer term

- Immediate management
  - (2) Risk assessment and determination of setting. Olivia may require hospitalisation, either voluntary or involuntary for containment of risk if still actively attempting to self-harm
  - Determine legal framework to manage Olivia
  - Biological: review medications and consider uptitration if required depending on dosages
  - (2) Psychoeducation of her symptoms being a consequence of her complex PTSD
- Longer-term
  - Biological medications including prazosin for management of her nightmares
  - Consider alternative medications if symptoms have not improved or resolved with antidepressant therapy
  - (2) Psychological support either via trauma-based cognitive behavioural therapy or eye-movement desensitising therapy. Consider skills-based therapies including dialectical-based therapy to manage self-harm
  - Provide appropriate supports to the family with her children
- **Missed**
  - (2) Chain analysis of links between triggers of abuse reminders and self-harm

### MEQ 1.2 Discuss the interventions that would be relevant for Olivia's family. Please give reasons for your choices. (8 marks)

- (2) Psychoeducation for the family including Olivia's husband and family. An explanation of Olivia's behaviours stemming from her previous trauma and experiences can alleviate concerns surrounding uncertainty for Olivia's actions in her family's eyes.
- Referral to Children of Parents with Mental Illness services to provide support and potential case management
- Multidisciplinary approach with involvement of allied health including occupational therapy and social work
  - (2) Assessment of Olivia's ability to care for her children

  - Consider Department of Communities and Justice referral to ensure wellbeing of her children and to prevent recurrent cycles of trauma
- (2) Supportive therapy and/or counselling for her children and family members if they wish to manage their own experiences watching this
- **Missed**
  - (1) Assessment of attachment with the infant or younger child

### MEQ 1.3 Olivia has just found out that she is pregnant again as a result of having sex with her husband when on weekend leave from hospital. She and her husband are concerned about the effects of her psychotropic medication on the baby. Outline the information and options you would discuss with Olivia and her husband. Please provide adequate detail. (10 marks)

- Information to discuss
  - It would be important to determine the likely age of the foetus
  - (2) Attitudes towards the baby: whether it is wanted, whether they would not like to proceed with the pregnancy. **Missed**: capacity to consent
  - (2) Discuss the effects of the medications on the pregnancy
    - (2) Sodium valproate is teratogenic and can cause neural tube defects
    - (2) Paroxetine can cause agitation with discontinuation syndromes in the newborn
    - Diazepam can cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. **Missed**: cleft palate abnormalities in first trimester
  - Discuss the indication of the medication in regards to mental state
    - Psychotropic medications in this situation would be targeted at managing depression
    - Untreated depression also has severe risks including risk of suicide and self-harm potential leading to her baby
    - Pregnancy with hormonal changes can also impact mental state
  - Discuss crucial timings of when medications will have the most effect on the pregnancy ie. the first trimester
  - (2) Impact of medications on breastfeeding and placental passage
- Options
  - Termination of pregnancy: depending on what Olivia and her husband wants
    - Followed by discussion of contraception
  - Continuing the current medications: which is not recommended due to known teratogencity
  - Switching to different medications
    - Olivia remains symptomatic on her current medication suggesting that it is not working
    - Would be a viable option to switch to alternative medications
  - Ceasing medications
    - Due to current psychiatric state, this would need to be carefully done with taper
    - Ultimately Olivia if has capacity
**Missed**
- (2) Referral to PIMHS and obstetric services regarding the above

## MEQ 2

Maria, aged 25 years, has a history of epilepsy since early childhood with multiple seizure types, a poor response to anticonvulsants, and longstanding cognitive difficulties (her full-scale IQ is 65). She lives with her parents in a small country town, and intermittently attends a supported work program packing boxes of fruit. She was admitted in status epilepticus to a tertiary intensive care unit and was ventilated for 3 days. Two days ago, she was transferred to the neurology ward. Since waking up she has been telling her parents that "everyone is spying on me with satellite cameras," and that the nursing staff are saying horrible things about her. She is worried that the food is poisoned. You are asked by the neurology team to see Maria.

### MEQ 2.1 Discuss the information you would seek prior to seeing Maria. Please give reasons for your answers. (12 marks)

- Clarify expectations of the consulting team. Purpose of the consult including whether transfer of care or advice regarding diagnosis / management of new paranoia
- Staff attitudes towards above
- Current legal framework
- (1) Past psychiatric history. If Maria has prior diagnoses of primary psychotic illness, this may explain her current psychotic ideas
- Drug and alcohol usage. Is she withdrawing or intoxicated. Could substances have triggered her status epilepticus
- (2) Assessment of delirium. Disorientation, behaviour, whether this is ongoing behaviour or fluctuating
- Baseline behaviour as per parents. Is she trusting of people or regularly paranoid. Are there underlying paranoid personality traits.
- Assessment of mood and affect. 
- (2) Management of epilepsy: well controlled or is she still having regular seizures? Are these symptoms happening after seizures?
- (2) Current medications. Previous trials of medications.
- Presence of other psychotic symptoms including hallucinations.
- (2) Risk assessment. Actions she is using to protect herself including thoughts of self-harm as well as agitation and aggression toward staff.
- **Missed**
  - Family history of psychosis
  - Current medical state: potential anoxic damage
  - Investigation results: EEG, CT, MRI
  - Past management of seizure, whether there were post-ictal phenomena
  - Impact of environmental stimuli (?video EEG monitoring, low stimulus)

### MEQ 2.2 Give your differential diagnoses with a reason for each diagnosis. (6 marks)

> Structure: diagnostic hierarchy

- Organic
  - (2) Post-ictal or inter-ictal psychosis: Maria has a history of epilepsy and is now having psychotic episodes
  - Temporal lobe epilepsy: Maria may be demonstrating psychotic behaviour whilst there are focal seizures
  - (2) Anoxic brain injury secondary to status epilepticus: new brain lesions leading to organic psychosis. **Encephlopathy**
- Substance-induced
  - Drug-induced psychosis: unknown drug use
  - (2) Delirium: withdrawal from substances, or secondary to other factors including those contributing to her status may explain her current behaviour
- Psychotic
  - (2) Primary psychotic illness eg. schizophrenia. Within the age range.
  - Affective disturbance with psychotic illness eg. depression
- **Missed**: misinterpreation of environmental cues due to low IQ

### MEQ 2.3 The neurologist is happy for Maria to remain under her care as the risk of further seizures is quite high. However, the nursing ward staff have now become anxious about managing Maria on the neurology ward because they feel she is "crazy" and may be a danger to the other sick patients. Describe how you would address the nursing staff's concerns. (7 marks)

- Psychoeducation. Maria's behaviour may be secondary to her medical condition. Maria does not have the capacity to manage her behaviour due to the impact of her seizures. Also low IQ so may have difficulty understanding the impact of their actions towards others
- Provide supportive counselling to nurses regarding the risks
- (2) Discuss PRNs as necessary if required to manage Maria's distress to herself as well as potential risks to others
- Discuss pathways of escalation including calling Codes or security depending on Maria's agitation and behaviour
- **Missed**: most of it
  - Family involvement
  - Ongoing review
  - Practical advice
  - Liaison with neurology
  
## MEQ 3

Lisa, aged 14 years, lives with her parents and younger sister. She is an excellent student in Year 10 and has until recently been very involved in competitive gymnastics. Lisa has been in a Paediatric ward for a week with a history of intermittent nausea and weight loss over several months. She has had a full medical assessment including an abdominal ultrasound, a gastroscopy and various blood and faecal tests. The paediatric gastroenterologist does not consider her symptoms to be due to any obvious pathological process and plans to discharge her today with a six-week follow-up appointment. The nursing staff ask for referral to psychiatry because they have noted that she avoids food and she has lost further weight while in hospital. They are concerned that she has an eating disorder. Lisa's parents reluctantly agree to you assessing her. 

### MEQ 3.1 As part of your comprehensive psychiatric assessment, describe how you would assess Lisa's eating behaviour. Do not cover the rest of the psychiatric assessment. (8 marks)

- Setting: ask to see Lisa privately without her parents to prevent any influence from the parents
- SCOFF questionnaire
- Discuss frequency of meals, amount of meals, contents of meals (whether avoiding certain foods)
- Discuss self-image. Discuss any weight goals/assessment
- Assess for restriction and/or weight loss/purging behaviours
- Assess for use of laxatives, intense exercise
- Discuss relation with food
- Discuss patterns of binging and whether there are time of feeling out of control with food
- Discuss attitudes towards peers and their eating behaviours particularly in competitive gymnastics
- Discuss if there are any medical complications: presyncope, palpitations, whether puberty has started
- **Missed**
  - Multimodal assessment, discuss with parents and nursing staff
  - Premorbbid eating history and dietary patterns/dietary preferences
  - Distress with food
  - Whether hiding food
  - Behaviours after eating food
  - Physical examination
  - BMI

### MEQ 3.2 Following your assessment, you make a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa restrictive sub-type. There is no other co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis. Lisa has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 14.5. You discuss the results of your assessment with Lisa and her parents and start arranging ongoing management. Several hours later the gastroenterologist contacts you to say that Lisa must be transferred to a psychiatric ward because Lisa's bed is needed for medical patients. A nurse takes you aside to tell you that Lisa has just told her that she will kill herself if she is made to eat, but does not want her parents told about this. What would you do in this situation? Who would you involve, and why? (8 marks)
