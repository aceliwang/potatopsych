## MEQ 1
Olivia is a 29-year-old, married mother of three children aged twelve months to eight years. She experienced significant sexual abuse in her childhood. Olivia has just been discharged to the local community mental health team at which you work, following a three-month admission to a nearby acute psychiatric inpatient unit. Prior to admission Olivia became depressed after hearing that her brother had been found guilty of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. She developed flashbacks and nightmares of her own experiences of abuse, and had frequent panic attacks. She was found by her oldest child with a cord around her neck, and admitted to hospital. Her hospital admission was characterised by recurrent episodes of self-harm including lacerating her arms and tying cords around her neck. She was treated with sodium valproate, paroxetine and diazepam. Olivia was eventually discharged on these medications still symptomatic.

### MEQ 1.1 Discuss the immediate and longer term psychiatric interventions you would suggest for Olivia's previous sexual abuse. Please give reasons for your choices. (7 marks)

  - It would be important to determine the likely age of the foetus
  - (2) Attitudes towards the baby: whether it is wanted, whether they would not like to proceed with the pregnancy. **Missed**: capacity to consent
  - (2) Discuss the effects of the medications on the pregnancy
    - (2) Sodium valproate is teratogenic and can cause neural tube defects

    - Diazepam can cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. **Missed**: cleft palate abnormalities in first trimester
  - Discuss the indication of the medication in regards to mental state
    - Psychotropic medications in this situation would be targeted at managing depression

  - (2) Impact of medications on breastfeeding and placental passage
- Options

## MEQ 2

Maria, aged 25 years, has a history of epilepsy since early childhood with multiple seizure types, a poor response to anticonvulsants, and longstanding cognitive difficulties (her full-scale IQ is 65). She lives with her parents in a small country town, and intermittently attends a supported work program packing boxes of fruit. She was admitted in status epilepticus to a tertiary intensive care unit and was ventilated for 3 days. Two days ago, she was transferred to the neurology ward. Since waking up she has been telling her parents that "everyone is spying on me with satellite cameras," and that the nursing staff are saying horrible things about her. She is worried that the food is poisoned. You are asked by the neurology team to see Maria.

### MEQ 2.1 Discuss the information you would seek prior to seeing Maria. Please give reasons for your answers. (12 marks)

- Clarify expectations of the consulting team. Purpose of the consult including whether transfer of care or advice regarding diagnosis / management of new paranoia
- Staff attitudes towards above
- Current legal framework
- (1) Past psychiatric history. If Maria has prior diagnoses of primary psychotic illness, this may explain her current psychotic ideas
- Drug and alcohol usage. Is she withdrawing or intoxicated. Could substances have triggered her status epilepticus
- (2) Assessment of delirium. Disorientation, behaviour, whether this is ongoing behaviour or fluctuating
- Baseline behaviour as per parents. Is she trusting of people or regularly paranoid. Are there underlying paranoid personality traits.
- Assessment of mood and affect. 
- (2) Management of epilepsy: well controlled or is she still having regular seizures? Are these symptoms happening after seizures?
- (2) Current medications. Previous trials of medications.
- Presence of other psychotic symptoms including hallucinations.
- (2) Risk assessment. Actions she is using to protect herself including thoughts of self-harm as well as agitation and aggression toward staff.
- **Missed**
  - Family history of psychosis
  - Current medical state: potential anoxic damage
  - Investigation results: EEG, CT, MRI
  - Past management of seizure, whether there were post-ictal phenomena
  - Impact of environmental stimuli (?video EEG monitoring, low stimulus)

### MEQ 2.2 Give your differential diagnoses with a reason for each diagnosis. (6 marks)

> Structure: diagnostic hierarchy

- Organic
  - (2) Post-ictal or inter-ictal psychosis: Maria has a history of epilepsy and is now having psychotic episodes
  - Temporal lobe epilepsy: Maria may be demonstrating psychotic behaviour whilst there are focal seizures
  - (2) Anoxic brain injury secondary to status epilepticus: new brain lesions leading to organic psychosis. **Encephlopathy**
- Substance-induced
  - Drug-induced psychosis: unknown drug use
  - (2) Delirium: withdrawal from substances, or secondary to other factors including those contributing to her status may explain her current behaviour
- Psychotic
  - (2) Primary psychotic illness eg. schizophrenia. Within the age range.
  - Affective disturbance with psychotic illness eg. depression
- **Missed**: misinterpreation of environmental cues due to low IQ

### MEQ 2.3 The neurologist is happy for Maria to remain under her care as the risk of further seizures is quite high. However, the nursing ward staff have now become anxious about managing Maria on the neurology ward because they feel she is "crazy" and may be a danger to the other sick patients. Describe how you would address the nursing staff's concerns. (7 marks)

- Psychoeducation. Maria's behaviour may be secondary to her medical condition. Maria does not have the capacity to manage her behaviour due to the impact of her seizures. Also low IQ so may have difficulty understanding the impact of their actions towards others
- Provide supportive counselling to nurses regarding the risks
- (2) Discuss PRNs as necessary if required to manage Maria's distress to herself as well as potential risks to others
- Discuss pathways of escalation including calling Codes or security depending on Maria's agitation and behaviour
- **Missed**: most of it
  - Family involvement
  - Ongoing review
  - Practical advice
  - Liaison with neurology

She has had a full medical assessment including an abdominal ultrasound, a gastroscopy and various blood and faecal tests. The paediatric gastroenterologist does not consider her symptoms to be due to any obvious pathological process and plans to discharge her today with a six-week follow-up appointment. The nursing staff ask for referral to psychiatry because they have noted that she avoids food and she has lost further weight while in hospital. They are concerned that she has an eating disorder.

Several hours later the gastroenterologist contacts you to say that Lisa must be transferred to a psychiatric ward because Lisa's bed is needed for medical patients.

Benzodiazepines and cannabinoids were also detected. On examination you find the patient to have a fluctuating level of consciousness. He is disoriented, highly distractible and over-active with repetitive, semi-purposeful movements. He is unable to give much coherent history, and talks of seeing little creatures in his room. His affect appears fairly cheerful and he tries to be cooperative. He is somewhat flushed and his chart indicates a mild pyrexia of 37.8 degrees. What causes of the patient's condition should be considered and what other information (from any available source) would help support or exclude these potential causes? (10 marks)

As far as she knows he does not use heroin or amphetamines. His pattern of alcohol use is mainly one of bingeing every few weeks and, when he can afford it, he uses marijuana daily. However, he lost his job a few months ago and since then he has been experimenting with readily obtainable psychoactive substances such as the panadeine forte which his father is prescribed for back pain. After Theo's overdose his mother noted that supplies of his father's medication for back pain and Parkinson's disease are also missing - the bottles are "diazepam" and "benzhexol". What is the most likely diagnosis?

- Multifactorial delirium
  - Benzodiazepine withdrawal
  - Anticholinergic delirium
- **Wrong**: not benzodaizepine withdrawal
- **More**
  - Benzhexol or trihexyphenidyl is anticholinergic used for management of Parkinsonian symptoms (tremors, spasms, stiffness)
