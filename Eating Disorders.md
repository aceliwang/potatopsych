# Eating Disorders

## Relevant Diagnoses

- Anorexia nervosa
- Bulimia nervosa
- Binge eating disorder
- Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder
- Other specified
- Unspecified

# Approach

- Assessment
  - Screening: SCOFF
  - Physical stability: weight =/= stability
  - Objective: weight and physical markers
- Setting: inpatient or community
- Involving family without allocating blame
- Managing distress
- Recovery orientated framework
  - Working with strengths
  - Managing expectations
- Legal framework
  - 
- Management
  - Biological
    - Manage medical stability
    - Monitor for refeeding syndrome
    - Dietitian support
  - Psychological
  - Social
- Refer to a Eating Disorder Specialist or coordinator

# SCOFF QUestionnaire

- Any positive answer requires further assessment and escalation
- SCOFF
  - Do you make yourself SICK because you feel uncomfortable full?
  - Do you worry about lost CONTROL over how much you eat?
  - Have you LOST more than 6kg in a three month period?
  - Do you think you're FAT when others say you're too thin?
  - Does FOOD dominate your life?

# Refeeding Syndrome

- Definition: nil formal one exists. Understood as shifts in fluid and electrolytes in malnutritioned patients being refed due to hormonal and metabolic changes
- Key markers: hypophosphataemia with issues in sodium, fluid, potassium, glucose and magnesium
- Pathophysiology
  - Starving patient (minimal intake for at least 5 days)
    - Low glucose > body uses alternative sources (fat and muscle)
      - Lipolysis > increased free fatty acids > ketones aren't used and thus increase
      - Ultimately loss of fat and muscle tissue
    - Low vitamins and micronutrients > direct drop in serum K, PO4, Mg > osmotic shift of above from intracellular compartment to serum
  - Refeeding process ie. introduction of glucose
    - Glucose presence spikes insulin secretion
    - Effects of insulin
      - K, PO4, Mg gets pumped into cells and serum levels drop
      - ATP and 2,3-DPG are depleted > tissue hypoxia



    - Uses fat and protein instead of carbohydrates for energy with drop in basal metabolic rate by 25%
    - Body attempts to save muscle
    - Muscle switches from ketones to fatty acids for energy, increasing free ketones
    - Liver drops gluconeogenesis to preserve muscle

- Inpatient admission is part of the recovery process and definitely not curative
