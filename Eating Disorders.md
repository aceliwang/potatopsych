# Eating Disorders

## Relevant Diagnoses

- Anorexia nervosa
- Bulimia nervosa
- Binge eating disorder
- Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder
- Other specified
- Unspecified

# Approach

- Assessment
  - Screening: SCOFF
  - Physical stability: weight =/= stability
  - Objective: weight and physical markers
- Setting: inpatient or community
- Involving family without allocating blame
- Managing distress
- Recovery orientated framework
  - Working with strengths
  - Managing expectations
- Legal framework
  - 
- Management
  - Biological
    - Manage medical stability
    - Monitor for refeeding syndrome
    - Dietitian support
  - Psychological
  - Social
- Refer to a Eating Disorder Specialist or coordinator

# SCOFF Questionnaire

- Any positive answer requires further assessment and escalation
- SCOFF
  - Do you make yourself SICK because you feel uncomfortable full?
  - Do you worry about lost CONTROL over how much you eat?
  - Have you LOST more than 6kg in a three month period?
  - Do you think you're FAT when others say you're too thin?
  - Does FOOD dominate your life?

# Adult Eating Disorder Inpatient Criteria

- Medical vs psychiatric care is essentially determined by risk of refeeding syndrome
- Criteria is as follows for NSW Health:
  - Weight
    - BMI < 16 (hospital) or BMI < 14 (medical)
    - Rapid weight loss of more than 1kg/week
    - Grossly inadequate nutritional intake
  - Vitals
    - SBP < 90 (hospital) or SBP < 80 (medical)
    - Postural BP > 10mmHg (hospital), > 20mmhg (medical)
    - Tachycardia > 110 or bradycardia < 40bpm (medical)
    - Postural tachycardia > 10bpm
    - Temp < 35.5 (hospital) or < 35 (medical)
  - Bloods: FBC, EUC, LFT, CMP, glucose
    - Glucose < 3.5 (hospital) or < 2.5 (medical)
    - Sodium < 130 (hospital) or < 125 (medical)
    - Potassium < 3.5 (hospital) or < 3 (medical)
    - Magnesium < 1.0 (hospital) or < 0.7 (medical)
    - Phosphate 0.8 (hospital) or < 0.8 (medical)
    - Albumin < 35 (hospital) or < 30 (medical)
    - LFT derangement (hospital) or AST or ALT > 500 (medical)
    - Neutrophils < 2 (hospital) or < 1 (medical)
  - ECG: QTc prolongation, any arrhythmia, non-specific ST or T wave changes (medical)
  - Eating disorder symptoms
    - Vomiting > 4x day or lack of control (hospital)
  - Psychiatric risk: suicidal ideation, active self-harm, high agitation
  - Least restrictive care
    - Failure of community management
    - Aversive family relationships
- In summary
  - Weight, vitals and bloods
  - Failure of community management either due to inefficacy or ongoing family issues

# Approach
- Multidisciplinary input
  - Refer to eating disorder specialist if available, otherwise CL Psychiatry
  - Physician to manage medical safety
  - Dietitian to manage ongoing nutrition
- Involve family early



# Refeeding Syndrome

- Definition: nil formal one exists. Understood as shifts in fluid and electrolytes in malnutritioned patients being refed due to hormonal and metabolic changes
- Key markers: hypophosphataemia with issues in sodium, fluid, potassium, glucose and magnesium
- Pathophysiology
  - Starving patient (minimal intake for at least 5 days)
    - Low glucose > body uses alternative sources (fat and muscle)
      - Lipolysis > increased free fatty acids > ketones aren't used and thus increase
      - Ultimately loss of fat and muscle tissue
    - Low vitamins and micronutrients > direct drop in serum K, PO4, Mg > osmotic shift of above from intracellular compartment to serum
  - Refeeding process ie. introduction of glucose
    - Glucose presence spikes insulin secretion
    - Effects of insulin
      - K, PO4, Mg gets pumped into cells and serum levels drop
      - ATP and 2,3-DPG are depleted > tissue hypoxia



    - Uses fat and protein instead of carbohydrates for energy with drop in basal metabolic rate by 25%
    - Body attempts to save muscle
    - Muscle switches from ketones to fatty acids for energy, increasing free ketones
    - Liver drops gluconeogenesis to preserve muscle
- Clinical symptoms
  - Delirium (confusion) with irritability and sensory disturbances
  - Hyperglycaemia, polyuria
  - Muscle weakness affecting heart, respiratory and GIT
  - Ventilation difficulties, cardiac arrhythmias, arrest
- Management of eating disorder
  - MDT approach: gastro + CL Psych
  - 1:1 nursing typically required, limit accessto bathroom
- Management to reduce risk of refeeding syndrome
  - Dietitian consult for reintroduction of calories
    - Should be limited to 1000Cal/day with uptitration as tolerated
    - Requires adequate protein and fat
    - Must avoid underfeeding the patient
    - Consider NG feeding for consistent feeding including overnight
    - Limit food to only be from the ward. Avoid snacks due to diminishing appetite and/or laxative effects
  - Monitoring
    - Daily bloods, BSL QID
    - Vitals BD
    - Weight
  - Replacement
    - Replacement of multivitamins, thiamine and zinc.
    - Replacing phosphate, magnesium and calcium as required.



# Eating Disorders Toolkit
- Inpatient admission is part of the recovery process and definitely not curative
