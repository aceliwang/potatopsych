## Psychosis in PD
- **Symptoms**:
  - Visual hallucinations, more in dim lighting or end of day
  - Initially preserved insight
  - Delusions: erotomaniac, jealous, persecutory
- **Risk factors**: sleep disorders
- **Aetiology**
  - Poorly understood
  - Could be secondary to dopaminergic medication. Increased risk with anticholinergics and dopamine agonists compared to levodopa or COMT inhibitors
- **Consequences**
  - Caregiver distress
  - Institutionalisation
- **Management**
  - Exclude organic delirium
  - Prevent delirium particularly with engagement
  - Nil management required if infrequent or not distressing
  - Balance of motor vs psychotic symptoms
    1. Reduce or lower anticholinergics and dopamine agonists
    2. Atypical antipsychotic
         - Avoid typical antipsychotics + risperidone âˆµ EPSE
           - Olanzapine also worsens motor function
         - Increases risk of mortality through sedation and falls
         - Try quetiapine (best tolerated) up to 100-200mg. 
         - If nil response, consider low-dose clozapine (evidence-based). Note monitoring. Titrate from 6.25mg, usual dose 25-35mg.
  - If comorbid dementia, consider cholinesterase inhibitor (not donepezil)
  - Last resort: ECT. Psychotic and motor symptoms improve albeit high potential for delirium.
- **Future**
  - Pimavanserin: not yet available in Australia
- **MEQ**
  - Liaise with neurological team
