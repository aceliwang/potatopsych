# Elimination Disorders

## Normal Development

- Nocturnal faecal continence > diurnal fecal continence > diurnal bladder control > nocturnal bladder control
- Dependent on intellectual capacity, social maturity, cultural determinants and psychological interactions with parents
- Ages 1-3: development of cortical inhibitory pathways for voluntary control of bladder and  bowel
- Encopresis
  - Should only be diagnosed past 4 years old as per DSM-5
- Enuresis
  - Should only be diagnosed past 5 years old as per DSM-5

## Encopresis

- Causes
  - Intentional elimination
    - In response to punitive parents to elicit negative reactions
  - In response to stressful emotions
  - Difficulties focusing: forgets to control sphincter
  - Overflow from constipation
    - Prolonged rectal distension impairs the stretch reflex
- Associations
  - High rates of abnormal anal sphincter contractions
  - Difficulties with sphincter relaxation > do not respond well to laxatives
- Management
  - If constipated: regular laxatives eg. PEG +/- surgical disimpaction
    - 
  - Bowel training methods: regular schedules (5 mins/day BD or TDS)
  - Cognitive behavioural therapy
    - Attempt to establish schedule
    - Diminishes anxiety with bowel movement
  - Psychoeducation of family and school
    - Management plan for changing of underwear
  - Considerations
    - High stigma from family members particularly peers
    - Low self-esteem, ongoing social rejection
    - Perpetuated by high EE
- Prognosis
  - Dependent on cause, chronicity and co-existing behaviour
  - Can self-limit, typically does not continue beyond middle adolescence
