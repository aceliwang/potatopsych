## Report Writing

John has been reluctantly seeing you monthly. He tells you that the work environment has become unbearable. After an incident at work, which involved an altercation with students, John has taken time off due to sickness. 5 months later you receive a letter from WorkCover outlining that they need a report from you regarding John. They have also sent a request for his notes. 

> List the key points in your approach to this request

- Discuss with John the request regarding report, WorkCover and his notes
