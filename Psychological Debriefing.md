# Psychological Debriefing

<!-- ## Definitions
- Nil structure
- Typically involves a single counselling intervention between 1 to 3 hrs within days of the event
- Offered for example in NSW Hunter Valley bus accident, 9/11 terrorist attacks -->

## Intentions
- "The belief that feelings must be shared"
- Belief that people will suffer PTSD if they do not immediately "talk through their trauma"
- Intent to decrease distress and to prevent development of PTSD
- Encourages and normalises emotional expression and responses to trauma
- Also known as:
  - Crisis intervention approaches
  - Group psychological debriefing
  - Critical incident stress debriefing
  - Process debriefing
- People want to help after trauma: shelter, first aid with a shift to "psychological debriefing"
- Increase in popularity during wartime, attempt to get people back to combat mode
- Attempt to decrease litigation and work-cover compensation for PTSD

<!-- ## Evidence Against
- Majority of people adapt to traumatic events without requiring formal intervention
- 75% of trauma survivors do not experience long-term distress from trauma
- The rest have short term reactions with subsequent adjustment: ie. manage with informal supports
- 10% experience chronic psychological problems related to trauma: ie. require formal supports -->


- Dating back to 2004
- Debriefing can increase the risk of PTSD
  - Risk factors
    - More distressed in acute phase
- Trauma memories are over-consolidated due to emotional disclosure

If 90% are fine without formal trauma support, why are we bothering?

## Lack of Evidence For
- There is minimal consensus on what exactly psychological debriefing is
- Debriefing is ineffectives
- Increases risk of negative outcomes: post-traumatic symptoms
- Debriefing is poorly defined in RCTs: bundle of procedures that have been clumped together

Risk vs benefit analysis
- Sure, there's a potential benefit right, as we would hope to intend
- However, are there risks?

## Risks
- Increased rate of post-traumtic symptoms relative to no treatment
- Increases risk of depression
- Interferes with natural recovery following traumatic event
- Prolongs the process of recovery
- Debriefing "medicalises" normal distress by generating expectations of pathological responses
- Debriefing can exacerbate distress, particularly in avoidant personality styles
  - Nil long-term therapy guaranteed
  - Remove their defences and replace it with nothing

## Studies
- Hobbs 1996, at 3 years, more severely psychological injured
- Those with higher Impact of Event scores initially, performed worse at 3 years
  - Appeared by 4 months after intervention, maintained at follow-up
- Issues with attrition makes estimation of effect size difficult

## What should we be doing?
- Assess suitability for psychological intervention
  - Universal debriefing does no prior assessment
- Typically, if patient wants it, they will ask for it
- Psychological first aid: coping strategies and fundamental support without emotional disclosure
  - Risks of making it difficult to assess efficacy. Not targeting any prevention
- Trauma therapy is still required, however typically in weeks to months later
- Brief CBT for acute stress disorder


<!-- # Conclusion
- Ethically dubious
- First, do no harm
- Second, no benefit to the patient
  - What little benefit is dubious
- Third, wasted resources
- Something might be effective, but it's not psychological debriefing -->

# why we should not do universal psychological debriefing after trauma

> Do no harm

<!-- Why we should not do universal psychological debriefing after exposure to big-T trauma? -->

# define: *psychological debriefing*

- No formal definition
- Typically involves:
  - single counselling intervention within days of the event
  - lasts between 1 to 3 hrs
- Aims:
  - reduce acute psychological distress
  - prevent onset of post-traumatic stress disorder
- Examples:
  - NSW Hunter Valley bus accident 2023
  - September 11 attacks 2001

<!-- So firstly, let's start off with what psychological debriefing is. There have been no formal guidelines describing what psychological debriefing is, which makes it murky to start with. What we do know is that it normally involves a single session of up to 3 hrs within days after the event. There is no other accepted criteria for something to be labelled as psychological debriefing in regards to who performs it and what it entails. Despite the former, its use is aimed to reduce the amount of acute distress following trauma exposure and then to prevent the onset of PTSD in the long-term. These were used previously quite publically in the NSW Hunter Valley bus accident last year that led to the 10 deaths and more historically in terrible events including 9/11.  -->

# dubious evidence for

- how can we know if it works if we barely know what it is?

<!--
So, firstly let's consider the question of how do we study this and find useful evidence for it if we cannot 

-->

# why do we do it?

- Historically: in war, get people better to go back to fighting
- Belief that repression is unhealthy in the long term
- Makes people feel good for doing something
- If we can send shelter and supplies, why not psychological support?
- Currently:
  - moral and legal obligation to prevent development of work-related injury through vicarious trauma
  - employers offer it to attempt to avoid future work-compensation claims


<!--
So why is psychological debriefing done?

Psychological debriefing was first introduced in the World Wars to get people back to the combat areas after experiencing psychological trauma. Preventing PTSD was a convenient byproduct, the main aim was to patch people up good enough and to remotivate them to send them back out to continue the fighting. 

In addition to the noble aims as described before, we can also consider the psychoanalytic and practical aspects. One of the key tenets of psychodynamic psychotherapy is that insight can bring about change and what better way is there to bring about insight than to talk about your emotions and experiences. And surely, the earlier the better right?

Furthermore, for everyone other than the exposed people, we get to feel better about it right? We send plenty of first-aid supplies to disaster zones, why not also send some psychological support and some councillors? The councillors get to feel like they're doing something and the rest of the public feel better for doing something as well. And nowadays, considering the evolving definition of PTSD with the addition of vicarious trauma through employment, employers have to try and do something to be seen to be preventing work-related injuries. Psychological debriefing is cheap and quick with the one session and so what better way to shut up claims in the future?

So as you can see, there's a lot of competing agendas here to promote the use of psychological debriefings, not all of them prioritising the patient. But despite all these stakeholders, who cares if employers and do-gooders benefit as long as the patient is benefiting right? But let's look at some of the numbers.

# stats

Trauma survivors:
- **75%**: no long-term distress
- **15%**: short-term distress + resolution with informal supports
- **10%**: chronic distress

TODO: reference

<!-- 

Obviously a bit hard to study, but the numbers suggest that approximately three quarters of people who are exposed to such trauma are fine. They accept that things have happened, and they move on with their life. 15% of people of people will have some short-term distress. There have been no diagnoses noted, but this would be akin to an acute stress disorder requiring some increased supports, typically informal. And the last 10% are the ones who do end up having chronic distress related to the trauma, which we would consider as the PTSD.

> # If 90% of trauma survivors end up fine, how much benefit is there really with universal psychological debriefing?

<!-- I guess this then raises the question, if 90% of trauma survivors end up fine, is there really any benefit to performing psychological debriefing? -->

# risk vs benefit analysis

Low cost
Humanitarian kindness
Aims:
- Reducing acute psychological distress
- Preventing onset of PTSD

**What's the harm?**

<!-- First things first, let's consider the risk vs benefit analysis as we always need to in psych. Hypothetically, it seems like there's minimal risk with psychological debriefing right? Patients receive some counselling after a traumatic event. Although 90% probably would have been fine without it, 10% might improve? Although that's a small number, IF there was no risk, what's the harm right?

-->

# mixed evidence for

- TODO

---
# clear evidence against

- increased rate of PTSD compared to no treatment
- increased rate of depression
- increased length of recovery

<!-- Well, contrary to the well-meaning intentions of providing people with cheap and quick therapy, it turns out this may actually produce iatrogenic harm in patients. People who were followed following engagement in psychological debriefing were actually seen to have increased rates of PTSD and depression and the ones who did recover actually took longer to do so. Thus we actually have low benefit and an element of risk. -->


---
# what happens if psychological debriefing occurs?

- Natural recovery following trauma is complex
  - Dependent on personality style, previous trauma
- Interference with natural recovery
- "Medicalises" normal distress thus generating expectations of pathology
- Removes people's defences, but doesn't replace them
  - No guarantee of long-term therapy

<!-- So how does this happen? We're not entirely too sure. The mind is complex as we know. Recovery and adjustment is also difficult and of course is dependent on personality, established coping mechanisms and previous exposure to trauma. Psychological debriefing is obviously not part of that natural recovery process and thus interferes with it. Furthermore, by adding medical and psychological intervention so early on, victims are placed into the "sick role" with expectations of potential pathological symptoms. By forcing people to debrief and to discuss their emotions, we remove their defences during that one session, with no time nor resources to replace them with other defences, essentially causing more harm than good.
-->


---
# what should we do instead?

- Patients should be looking for help and determined as suitable
- Trauma-focused CBT, with exposure-response prevention
- Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR)

<!--
Instead of treating universally with everyone who is exposed to trauma, this should only be reserved for those who are actually experiencing distress that is not responding to time and informal supports. We have strong evidence-based treatments which don't leave patients hanging and adequately address and treat for pathological symptoms which are actually present.

# conclusion

Ethically dubious

1. Do no harm
2. There is no beneficence in this case
3. Utilitarian waste of resources

Less is more

<!-- 
When we consider this from multiple lenses, from the ethics, from the risk vs benefit analysis and from the perspective of resources, it's harmful, there's no benefit and it's a waste of people's time and resources. Ultimately, psychological debriefing should be avoided.
