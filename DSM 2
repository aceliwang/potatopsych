# Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder
(F94.2)
- A. A pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and interacts with unfamiliar adults and exhibits at least two of the following:
    - 1. Reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with unfamiliar adults.
    - 2. Overly familiar verbal or physical behavior (that is not consistent with culturally sanctioned and with age-appropriate social boundaries).
    - 3. Diminished or absent checking back with adult caregiver after venturing away, even in unfamiliar settings.
    - 4. Willingness to go off with an unfamiliar adult with minimal or no hesitation.
- B. The behaviors in Criterion A are not limited to impulsivity (as in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) but include socially disinhibited behavior.
- C. The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced by at least one of the following:
    - 1. Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of having basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection met by caregiving adults.
    - 2. Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit opportunities to form stable attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care).
    - 3. Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to form selective attachments (e.g., institutions with high child-to-caregiver ratios).
- D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed behavior in Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A began following the pathogenic care in Criterion C).
- E. The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months.
- Specify if:
    - Persistent: The disorder has been present for more than 12 months.
- Specify current severity:
    - Disinhibited social engagement disorder is specified as severe when the child exhibits all symptoms of the disorder, with each symptom manifesting at relatively high levels.

    - Note: Criterion A4 does not apply to exposure through electronic media, television, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work related.
- B. Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred:
    - 1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event(s).
        - Note: In children older than 6 years, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the traumatic event(s) are expressed.
