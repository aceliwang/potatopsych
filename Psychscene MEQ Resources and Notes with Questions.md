55 year old male with Depression 
John is a 55 year old principal of a local school who is referred to you privately, by his general practitioner for further assessment and treatment. He has recently had a myocardial infarction 6 months ago. He is a successful teacher and lives with his wife and three children. He has been trialled on 3 different SSRI's without any significant benefits. 
Outline John's causes for treatment resistance and the salient features you would look for in assessment
1. Risk assessment : Late onset depression in males can be associated with an elevated risk of suicide. I will evaluate the risk of suicide and keep a high index of suspicion. 
2. Compliance with medication: He may perceive depression as stigmatising, not willing to engage or seek help, not willing to obtain psychological treatment. There may be negative family attitudes to medication. Side effects of medication (Refer to the factors affecting insight : Personal factors (attitudes to medication and stigma), Medication factors (side effects, complexity of regime, non effectiveness), Illness factors (resistant type of illness, delusions against treating team, lack of trust and System factors (cost, lack of therapeutic alliance)
3. Incorrect diagnosis: Bipolar disorder/ Bipolar depression or Major depressive disorder with mixed features . Antidepressants may worsen the long term course of depression and hence this may be a factor. Clues towards bipolarity include (WHIPLASHED): Worse or wired with antidepressants, Hypomania / mood swings, Irritability, Psychomotor retardation, Loaded family history, Abrupt termination of depressive episodes, Seasonal affective syndrome, Hypersomnia or Hyperphagia, Early onset of depression and Delusions, hallucinations and psychotic features.)
4. Late onset depression can be more resistant to treatment as it can be associated with vascular features and white matter hyper intensities. (Vascular Depression Hypothesis). Clues to vascular depression include vascular factors (MI, dyslipedemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, TIA's, migraine). The presentation also includes apathy rather than complaints of low mood, agitation or retardation , hypochondriacal and obsessive thoughts, pseudo dementia). Medical history and Physical examination may reveal Raynaud's, calf claudication etc)
5. Cognitive dysfunction: Frontal lobe examination with Luria 3 step test, alternate sequencing, Clock face test. Frontal lobe disease, vascular neuro-cognitive impairment can present with depression as the first presentation. 
6. Drug and Alcohol use disorder: assess for craving, compulsion, use despite physiological and psychological harm for benzodiazepines, alcohol, amphetamines and opiates
7. Psychological factors:
a. Personality disorder: Perfectionistic , Narcissistic, Avoidant and Dependant traits may interfere with optimal therapeutic treatment
b. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood: Work, financial and relationship stressors
8. Other medication such as Beta blockers, diuretics , ACEI are associated with depression 
9. Organic mood disorder: Thyroid dysfunction, Addison's disease

Depressed male with agitation- Management principles 
During your assessment he tells you that he is certain that he is unable to provide for his family and that they are facing financial ruin. He is growing increasingly despondent about this. He says he cannot afford to come and see you. His wife finds him pacing about during the day and reports that there is no issue financially and that despite any assurances from work or family, he continues to worry about the future. His wife says that he stays up all night pacing. 
Outline the key aspects of your management plan
1. Risk management: This depression may be agitated depression that is associated with a high risk of suicide. Therefore I will keep a high index of suspicion and consider a low threshold for admission. This a challenging case as he may not want to consider an admission. If treated in the outpatients then I would arrange close follow up. 
2. Symptoms are suggestive of a more severe form of depression such a psychotic depression which according to NICE, RANZCP guidelines requires a combination of noradrenergic and dopaminergic antidepressant along with an antipsychotic. The thoughts seem to be nihilistic delusions which along with agitation indicate a possible psychotic depression
3. Establishing therapeutic alliance with patient and family is important. Encourage him to attend to discuss possibilities and avoid coercion.
4. If he lacks capacity to make decision for himself due to complete lack of insight and a significant risk of harm exists to himself or family then admission under the mental health act may be needed for assessment and management
5. Choice of medication: Choice of medication is complicated by his cardiac involvement. SNRI's such as duloxetine, higher dose venlafaxine can affect the heart as can antipsychotics (QTc prolongation) and a cardiologist involvement will be important. Pre and Post ECG will be required. Initiation of medication may be best done by considering an inpatient admission f he agrees. A risk benefit analysis will be done
6. Location of admission: being a principal of a school, admission may need to be considered in another area due to stigma. If he has private insurance he may be able to be admitted in a private hospital. 
7. If affective features or mixed features are present he may need additional mood stabilisers such as Valproate or Lamotrigine
8. Address Drug or Alcohol dependence by involving the dual diagnosis services. Detoxification if necessary would be best done in an inpatient setting in view of his recent MI
9. Close liaison with cardiologist as Heart disease and depression exist in a bi-directional relationship 
9. The depression may prove resistant to treat due to the presence of White matter hyper intensities on MRI associated with vascular depression. I will obtain a second opinion and am aware that ECT is an evidenced based treatment in psychotic depression and resistant cases. An informed consent is necessary if patient has capacity otherwise the Mental health act will have to be considered. I will discuss with senior peers
10. Family should be kept involved at all times

Ethical issues in report writing - Civil
John has been reluctantly seeing you monthly. He tells you that the work environment has become unbearable. After an incident at work, which involved an altercation with students, John has taken time off due to sickness. 5 months later you receive a letter from WorkCover outlining that they need a report from you regarding John. They have also sent a request for his notes. 
List the key points in your approach to this request
1. Dual agency dilemma / Conflict of interest : I will clarify my role. Are you providing a report as a treating doctor or as an independent psychiatrist. (As an independent psychiatrist you will be assisting court whilst as a treating psychiatrist you will act in the best interest of the patient)
2. Privacy and Confidentiality: The doctor patient relationship is confidential except in certain circumstances where disclosure is required by law such as harm to children, harm to third party or harm to self. In this case, I will seek advice from my medico-legal insurance as to my obligations in providing the notes.
3.  Autonomy and informed consent: I will also speak to the patient and inform him of the request. I will obtain informed consent from the patient after explaining the process and explaining my role. 
4. Beneficience: If I were to provide a report will I be acting in the best interest of my patient? 
5. Non-Maleficence: If I write a report or provide notes, will my patient come to harm? 

Management of Patient suicide
John's mental state deteriorates over the next few months. You admit him to a private hospital. 6 days into the admission you receive a phone call from the ward stating that John has committed suicide. 
Outline how you would proceed
1. Attend ward and gather information: How, when, who witnessed it. Have police been informed?  Has the clinical director and NUM been informed? 
2. Advise staff to isolate the body and not disturb the scene until police arrive. 
3. Inform clinical director and NUM personally
4. Document last mental state, ask staff to ensure adequate documentation. Photocopy notes and keep one copy as it will be required for the coroner
5. Inform family: This is best done after discussing it with staff and director as to the best way to inform family. A face to face meeting with a staff member that the family knew would be appropriate. Respect family wishes. 
6. Offer the family opportunity to ask questions, vent anger and hostility. If family wishes to complain, explain avenues to do this i.e complaints pathway. 
7. Inform family of supports available and identify any vulnerable individuals in the family that may need additional support
8. Staff debriefing
9. Patient debriefing to avoid rumours spreading and to maintain trust in the therapeutic relationship. 
10. Contact medicolegal insurance and inform them
11. Coroner's report preparation will be necessary once a request if obtained
12. Psychological autopsy / Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
13. Self reflection: speak to colleagues and obtain advice
14. Case conference to learn from incident

Debt and Mental Illness- Principles
1. Clarify role: Your role is not to provide financial advise but to refer patients to appropriate individuals and liaise with organisations to assist the patient
2. Advise patient not to ignore the problem
3. Identify priority debts and advise patient to contact and inform respective organisations e.g banks, utility companies
3. Is the client thinking of borrowing more money? 
4. Is there a mental illness that may be impacting on financial stability? e.g. mania, gambling, substance use disorder
5. Involve social worker
6. Maximise client government benefits
7. Refer to a debt advisor or financial advisor
8. Refer to legal aid if legal issues present. 
9. Support letters can be sent to bodies advocating for flexibility e.g interest only payments on mortgage etc. 
10. Involve consumer consultant

Young Male with Schizophrenia- Assessment of Risk
 
Stan is a 20 year old indigenous male. He has been admitted to the mental health unit after a violent assault on his father. His parents report that he has not been himself over the last 6 months and has been seeing talking to himself on a number of occasions. He is also reported to smoke cannabis on a regular basis. 
List the short and long term risk factors you would assess for in this case that would increase the risk of violence?
This question can be answered by using the HCR-20 in the diagram. 
Additionally one must add the cultural aspects that play a role. 
1. Holistic model of health
2. Distrust of 'Western mental health practices' 
3. Lack of availability of indigenous mental health liaison workers
4. Geographical isolation and poor follow up
5. Negative family attitudes to medication and societal stigma
6. Specific issues related to non-compliance as outlined in notes. 
 

Young Indigenous Male with Schizophrenia-Ongoing Symptoms
Following your assessment of Stan an indigenous male, you diagnose him with schizophrenia. His medical investigations are normal. You find out that he has been admitted previously to another mental health unit where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was started on Risperidone 6 mg, which he stopped 9 months ago. He continues to complain of ongoing auditory hallucinations but refuses to take any medication.
 Outline your approach to this situation.
List the factors affecting compliance in this case? 
Outline how you would specifically address his resistant hallucinations after finding out he was compliant with medication.
 1. Attempt to establish therapeutic alliance and assess for factors affecting insight and compliance
a. Personal factors 
•	Cultural aspects (holistic understanding of health, alternate explanatory models of illness)
•	negative attitudes to medication
•	Stigma
•	Familial negative attitudes ot mental illness
b. Medication factors
•	Side effects of medication: EPSE's (AIMS examination), High prolactin levels and sexual side effects, gynaecomastia, weight gain, sedation and slowing down
•	Difficulty remembering to take medication
•	Ineffectiveness of medication
c. Illness factors: 
•	Delusions and hallucinations regarding treatment
•	Personality factors with lack of trust
•	Cognitive impairment 
•	Substance use 
d. System factors: 
•	Lack of cultural sensitivity
•	Absence of culturally trained workers and absence of indigenous mental health liaison workers
•	Distance to travel to see team 
•	Cost
Treatment of resistant hallucinations
1. Provide psychoeducation to patient about treatment options and attempt to engage him
2. Rule out organicity: MRI scan , TFT's 
3. Rule out substance use
4. Switch antipsychotics to alternate one like Olanzapine or Asenapine
5. If non-compliance is an issue consider depot preparations. Issues such as consent and legal framework are to be considered. e.g CTO
6. If no response , discuss possibility of clozapine with patient and family with risks explained. Care to be taken in view of ethnic profile as higher risk of metabolic issues. 
7.  CBT and hearing voices group taking into account cultural aspects or one on one therapy tailored to patient incorporating cultural aspects and nature of voices. A particularly skilled therapist will be required to achieve this. involve the indigenous liaison worker. 
8. Augmentation strategies like mood stabiliser augmentation with antipsychotic
9. Music and headphones for distraction
10. Anxiety reduction strategies
11. TMS has some evidence but is not routine. 

Stigma and Mental Health - Community Management
After a 4 week admission Stan is better. The family is concerned about his being discharged in the community as it is an indigenous community and his parents are worried about the impact of this on Stan’s mental health. They do not want any community follow up from the CMHT, but want to go to the traditional healer.
 How would you manage this situation?
1. Arrange a meeting with parents and Stan: Involve a indigenous liaison worker if possible. 
2. Clarify specific concerns of the family: What do they feel will happen? How do they feel we can help? What do they think they would like?  
3. Provide psycho-education about schizophrenia and its treatment options. Attempt to establish therapeutic alliance by taking into account cultural issues
4. Explain that traditional healing systems and western models can co-exist side by side: We can work together with the traditional healer in a liaison model
5. Consider a meeting with community elders after obtaining consent from family and Stan. 
6. Reassurance provided in a realistic manner about role of mental health services: explain the nature of the team and community follow up. Also explain that if risk issues are present such as risk of harm to self or others legal aspects may be needed such as CTO or inpatient admission to protect Stan. At all points explain to the family that you will be acting in the best interest of Stan and Family. 
7. If media is involved than involve the service media liaison officer
8. Wider issues such as community education, combating stigma, employment for Stan. 

Motivational Interviewing Principles 
 
You have an obese patient with depression and diabetes.  The endocrinologist has reported that your patient has to lose weight to prevent the onset of Insulin Dependant Diabetes Mellitus. During the interview when you bring up the topic of losing weight, She says, “ I don’t need to follow my diet as long as I’m feeling OK.”
Outline your approach to the situation to assist the patient in losing weight.
(Please note that the same principles are applicable for Alcohol and the example used here is for alcohol dependence). 
Interviewing Principles (OARS)
1. Assess for stage of change
2. Ask Open-ended questions
•	I understand you have some concerns about your drinking (losing weight). Can you tell me about them?
3. Make Affirmations
•	The patient’s strengths and efforts for change are noticed and affirmed
•	I appreciate that it took a lot of courage for you to discuss your drinking (weight) with me today
•	You appear to have a lot of resourcefulness to have coped with these difficulties for the past few years
•	Thank you for hanging in there with me. I appreciate this is not easy for you to hear
4. Use Reflections to enhance cognitive dissonance
•	Involves rephrasing a statement to capture the implicit meaning and feeling of a patient’s statement
•	Encourages continual personal exploration and helps people understand their motivations more fully
•	You enjoy the effects of alcohol in terms of how it helps you unwind after a stressful day at work and helps you interact with friends without being too self-conscious. But you are beginning to worry about the impact drinking is having on your health. In fact, until recently you weren’t too worried about how much you drank because you thought you had it under control. Then you found out your health has been affected and your partner said a few things that have made you doubt that alcohol is helping you at all
•	I understand that you feel OK and have not considered losing weight. I acknowledge that it is a difficult topic for you to discuss but I want to touch on the impact of your weight on your health. Is that OK? (Since patient is at precontemplation).
•	What are the advantages of not losing weight? What are the disadvantages?
5. Use Summarising
•	Links discussions and ‘checks in’ with the patient
•	If it is okay with you, just let me check that I understand everything that we’ve been discussing so far. You have been worrying about how much you’ve been drinking in recent months because you recognise that you have experienced some health issues associated with your alcohol intake, and you’ve had some feedback from your partner that she isn’t happy with how much you’re drinking. But the few times you’ve tried to stop drinking have not been easy, and you are worried that you can’t stop. How am I doing?
4 further principles 
1. Express Empathy
2. Roll with resistance
3. Enhance self efficacy
4. Develop discrepancy or enhance cognitive dissonance

Tacking Non-adherence due to Forgetfulness
A 52-year-old female who takes 2 antidepressants, 2 mood stabilisers and 2 antipsychotics along with metformin and anti-hypertensive reports that she finding it difficult to remember to take her medication. 
 List the strategies to assist her
1. Dosette box
2. Alarm clock, Mobile phone alarms
3. Post it's 
4. Simplify regime e.g. all morning or note if possible
5. Involve family member in administration of medication
6. If lack of insight- adherence therapy incorporating motivational interviewing techniques
7. Depot medication
8. Rule out cognitive dysfunction and treat cause if possible 

Eating Disorders- Risk factors 
A 21 year old female has been recently diagnosed with an eating disorder. 
List the factors you would focus on in developing your formulation
•	Female gender
•	Being from the developed world where the ‘thin ideal’ prevails.
•	Migrants from the developing world
•	Those living in urban areas and undertaking life pursuits where body image concerns predominate, for example, competitive gymnastics and fashion modelling.
•	Genetic predisposition
•	Early menarche
•	Epigenetic changes to DNA structure: food deprivation, severe trauma
•	Family history of eating disorders
•	Early attachment and developmental difficulties
•	Premorbid obesity
•	Interpersonal problems
•	Dieting or other causes of rapid weight loss (Mitchison and Hay, 2014; Stice, 2002).
•	Rapid weight loss from any cause, including physical illness, can trigger cognitive changes
Psychological factors
•	A ‘milieu’ of weight concern in formative developmental years
•	Low self-esteem (all eating disorders)
•	High levels of clinical perfectionism for those with anorexia nervosa
•	Impulsivity for bulimic disorders.
•	Emotional and sexual child abuse increases personal vulnerability, most likely through impeding a robust sense of self-worth and adaptive coping. The eating disorder then provides a sense of improved self-esteem and self-control for the individual (Stice, 2002).
•	Obsessive thinking about food, in turn precipitating and perpetuating the symptoms of anorexia nervosa (Keys et al., 1950).
•	Positive reinforcement as maintaining factor e.g sense of achievement, societal reinforcement

Eating Disoder - Assessment
Jane is a 16-year-old female referred by her GP. She lives with her parents and younger sister. She presented to the GP with nausea and vomiting. Her medical investigations revealed a low potassium. The GP feels that she may have an eating disorder. 
 List the salient features in history, examination and formulation you would focus on to make a diagnosis
1. History Taking: Symptoms of anorexia nervosa which include but are not limited to: dietary restriction; weight loss; inability to restore weight; body image disturbance; fears about weight gain; binging; purging; excessive exercise; early satiety; constipation; and the use of laxatives, diuretics, or medications to lose or maintain low weight (APA, 2013). Symptoms of bulimia include preoccupation with food and compensatory behaviours after binges. 
2. Disturbed eating behaviours, e.g. eating apart from others and ritualistic patterns of eating such as prolonged meal times and division of food into very small pieces (Wilson et al., 1985).
3. Accurately assess nutritional and fluid intake: Specific enquiries made as to the adequacy of main meals and snacks consumed.
4. Collateral: Collateral sources such as family members and other clinicians involved in the person’s care should be utilised.
5. A brief physical examination including measurement of weight, height, calculation of BMI, seated and standing pulse rate to detect resting bradycardia and/or tachycardia on minimal exertion due to cardiac deconditioning, blood pressure (seated and standing) and temperature. These findings are needed to determine if immediate hospital admission is required. The assessment should also include any history of fainting, light-headedness, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, ankle swelling, weakness, tiredness and amenorrhoea or irregular menses. Check nails, swollen glands, dental caries etc. 
6. Investigations: Serum biochemistry to detect hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis or acidosis, hypoglycaemia, hypophosphataemia, and hypomagnesaemia, serum liver function tests, serum prealbumin levels and a full blood examination looking for evidence of starvation-induced bone marrow suppression such as neutropaenia and an electrocardiogram (ECG). A bone mineral density scan should be performed routinely if the person has been underweight for six months or longer with or without amenorrhea and thereafter every two years whilst still struggling with an eating disorder (Mehler et al., 2011).
7. Assessing psychiatric comorbidity: e.g. anxiety, depression, substance misuse, suicidality, personality disorders, anxiety disorders and deliberate self-harm. However, clinicians should be aware that depression, obsessional thinking, anxiety and other psychiatric symptoms can represent the reversible effects of starvation on the brain (Keys et al., 1950).
8. Cognitive Assessment: Assessing cognitive changes due to starvation such as slowed thought processing, impaired short-term memory, reduced cognitive flexibility and concentration and attention difficulties (Hatch et al., 2010).
9. Possible predisposing and precipitating factors: see risk factors in previous question
 If the question asked approach to assessment, risk assessment would be important and that would include stating that a low threshold for admission required if low pulse and BP with ECG and electrolyte changes. 

Anorexia Nervosa - Challenging Management
Following your assessment you make a diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa. She has a BMI of 14. On the paediatric ward where she has been admitted, she refuses to eat and threatens to kill herself if given food. The nursing staff has become hostile against the patient. They ask you to have her transferred to the psychiatric ward. 
 Outline your immediate management plan?
1. Ethical issue : Duty of care vs. Autonomy of patient. Since she is 16 she would have a guardian. Find out who are legal guardians. 
2. Arrange meeting with nursing staff with CL nurse: Acknowledge the difficulty in management and provide positive affirmation. Inform that team will be available to support them 
3. Inform paediatric team about the seriousness of the issue. BMI of 14 may indicate serious medical risks and a thorough medical evaluation and treatment to avoid refeeding syndrome is required and this is best provided on the medical ward as regular monitoring of vitals is required.
4. Provide psycho-education about Anorexia nervosa, personality factors and psychodynamic mechanisms resulting in anger or refusal of food. (projection, acting out, splitting, anger turned inwards etc.)
5. Arrange a nurse special either a medical nurse special or psychiatric nurse special. 
6. Provide ongoing psychiatric liaison
7. Inform guardian respecting confidentiality as maintaining confidentiality may be required to build trust and establish therapeutic alliance
8. Involve the specialist eating disorder service
9. If she refuses to eat with significant medical risks, speak to guardians, clinical director/ emergency guardianship tribunal to obtain advice about treatment and use of mental health act. This may differ from state to state and country to country. . 

Anorexia Nervosa-Psychoeducation to Family
She continues to remain on the paediatric ward. Her behaviour has settled. Her parents come to meet you to discuss management of their daughter’s condition. They feel that they are to blame for her condition.
Outline the key points you would cover in the discussion?
1. Establish therapeutic alliance: Explain the Anorexia Nervosa is an illness and that they are not to blame for this. Provide praise, encouragement and positive reinforcement as they will be important part of treatment.
There is no research evidence that proves a link between family dysfunction and the onset of anorexia nervosa, although research supports improved outcomes in anorexia nervosa when families are involved in treatment. 
2. Provide opportunity to ask questions first
3. Explain that anorexia is a eating disorder:
Anorexia nervosa occurs in about 0.5% of girls and young women in developed societies. 9 out of 10 individuals affected are females. 
4. Explain the seriousness of the illness but at the same time explain that it is treatable. 
It can lead to severe weight loss, chronic physical disabilities such as osteoporosis (bone loss with weakened bone structure and increased risk of fractures), growth retardation, infertility, impaired thinking and concentration, bowel and intestinal disorders and major disruptions to emotional, social and educational development. It can be life threatening.
People can fully recover from anorexia nervosa. Research says that if anorexia nervosa is treated early in its course, particularly in children and adolescents, then recovery occurs more quickly and more often than if treatment is delayed
5. Weight restoration is an essential first step in recovery but not a sign of recovery. It takes time to heal the mind from anorexia nervosa and restore a sufferer to a state where they are not dominated by negative feelings related to weight and food.
6. Explain that management will be as part of a multidisciplinary team with a psychologist, nurse, psychiatrist, dietician and family therapy
7. Psychological therapies: Inform that families play an important role in management and research shows that family therapy e.g Maudsley Family therapy ) is evidence based for the treatment of anorexia nervosa. 
(See components of family therapy in the next section)
8. Medication: Medication may be required if the obsessive thoughts are severe or if there is anxiety and depression. SSRI's (antidepressants) and antipsychotics such as olanzapine are indicated. 
9. Provide information about support groups 

Principles of Family Based Treatment in Anorexia Nervosa
1. Adolescent is embedded in the family and the involvement of the family is a key component of success. 
Phase 1 : Weight restoration: Therapist has a direct observation of the family's interaction patterns during eating. Therapist directs discussion (enhance circular communication) to reinforce a strong alliance between parents at promoting weight restoration in their child. 
Phase 2: Transitioning control of eating back to the adolescent 
Phase 3 : Adolescent issues and termination: After medical issues are addressed and patient has regained a normal weight. Enhancing separation individuation, addressing conflict, enhancing self efficacy. 
Other principles such as addressing high emotional expression, psychoeducation, allow family to vent anger and hostility, take feeling of blame away from parents remains. 

Refeeding Syndrome-Principles in Management
Refeeding syndrome can occur in Anorexia nervosa, chronic alcoholsim, oncology patients, sever depression and anyone with severe weight loss. 
Assessment 
•	Dietician assessment
•	Assess weight change, nutrition, alcohol intake and psychosocial issues
•	Investigations: PO4, Mg, NA and K
•	Glucose
Correct deficiencies with close monitoring with admission to a medical ward. 
Slow replenishment
Refeeding Syndrome (RANZCP Guidelines, 2014)
•	Refeeding syndrome is understood to be due to the switch from fasting gluconeogenesis to carbohydrate-induced insulin release triggering rapid intracellular uptake of potassium, phosphate and magnesium into cells to metabolise carbohydrates (Kohn et al., 2011).
•	The low body stores of such electrolytes due to starvation, can lead to rapid onset of hypophosphataemia, hypomagnesia and hypokalaemia. In addition, insulin-triggered rebound hypoglycaemia can occur, exacerbated by the fact that such patients have depleted glycogen stores.
•	Risk of refeeding syndrome can be reduced by ‘starting low’ and ‘going slow’ with nutrition, and monitoring serum phosphate, potassium and magnesium daily for the first 1–2 weeks of refeeding, and replacing these electrolytes immediately if they fall below normal range
•	The CPG group recommends taking a ‘middle path’ with adults, commencing refeeding at 6000kJ/day. This should be increased by 2000kJ/day every 2–3 days until an adequate intake to meet the person’s needs for weight restoration is reached.
•	This diet should be supplemented by phosphate at 500mg twice daily and thiamine at least 100mg daily for the first week, and thereafter as clinically indicated for people at high risk of refeeding syndrome (e.g. BMI <13).
•	For people at high risk of refeeding syndrome, commencing with continuous nasogastric feeding with low-carbohydrate preparations (i.e. 40–50% of energy from carbohydrates) seems prudent to avoid triggering postprandial rebound hypoglycaemia due to insulin secretion in people with inadequate glycogen stores.

Risk Factors in the Development of PTSD
A 71 year old Vietnam Veteran has long standing history of PTSD. He reported a traumatic upbringing with sexual abuse. 
List the main factors that would explain the development of PTSD (including others not in the vignette)
1. Pre-trauma: 
•	History of trauma
•	Life stressors
•	Poor coping skills
•	Low self esteem 
•	Genetic vulnerability
•	Brain structure - decreased hippocampal volume

Intellectual Disability, Schizophrenia and Epilepsy - Consultation Liaison 
Maria, aged 25 years, has a history of epilepsy since early childhood with multiple seizure types, a poor response to anticonvulsants, and longstanding cognitive difficulties (her full-scale IQ is 65). She lives with her parents in a small country town, and intermittently attends a supported work program packing boxes of fruit. She was admitted in status epilepticus to a tertiary intensive care unit and was ventilated for 3 days. Two days ago, she was transferred to the neurology ward. Since waking up she has been telling her parents that “everyone is spying on me with satellite cameras”, and that the nursing staff are saying horrible things about her. She is worried that the food is poisoned.
You are asked by the neurology team to see Maria. 
Question 
Outline the information you would seek before seeing Maria. 
1. Risk Assessment: 
•	Risk of harm to self and others
•	Risk of absconding
•	Risk of accidental self-injury
•	Current environment : observation level, 1 on 1 special , single room etc
2. Evidence for delirium: 
•	Acute onset, fluctuating cognition, reversal of sleep wake cycle.
•	EEG and seizure status- is she seizure free?
•	Blood tests : Electrolyte abnormalities, Infections (CRP and ESR with leucocytosis), Urine infection, Liver or renal abnormalities. MRI or CT scan to rule out focal lesions.
•	Alcohol use and Drug use: LFT and GGT for evidence of alcohol misuse as Alcohol withdrawal can present with delirium tremens the onset of which begins on 72 hours. History of alcohol or drug use. 
3. Evidence of psychosis:
•	In addition to delusions, is she complaining of auditory hallucinations, passivity phenomenon which could indicate schizophrenia. 
•	Is there a past history of psychsois – previous notes?
•	Medications: Is she on antipsychotics? Antipsychotics can reduce seizure threshold
•	Is she on anti epileptics that can worsen psychosis such as Levatiracetam, which is associated with risk of psychosis.
•	Is the dose stable or has that been changed. 
•	What has been her pre morbid functioning? 
4.  Evidence of Peri Ictal, Ictal or Post Ictal psychosis:
•	Temporality of symptoms to seizure activity
•	Last EEG and presence or absence of epileptic activity
•	Medications: Serum Levels of anti epileptics
•	Forced normalisation: Has the normalisation of the EEG unmasked psychotic symptoms?
•	Neurologist opinion.

Intellectual Disability, Schizophrenia and Epilepsy - Consultation Liaison 
Maria experiences another seizure and is now under observation in the neurology ward. Maria attempts to abscond from the ward on a number of occasions and the nursing staff call you as her parents have arrived and want to take maria home. They believe that the treatment is ' not doing her any good'. The nursing staff call you for advice. 
Question
Outline your immediate management plan
1. Attend the ward as soon as possible to clarify the situation
2. Manage risk by ensuring that Maria has one on one nurse special until the situation is addressed. 
3. Challenging situation as it is difficult to clarify whether the issue is due to delirium or medical condition which will require treatment under duty of care. If doubts are present obtain advice from emergency guardianship as part of good practice and involve clinical director and neurologist. 
 4. Arrange a family meeting (case conference with neurology team) to provide psychoeducation to the family about the treatment and risks involved. Risk of seizure may be high and Maria would need to remain in hospital. Provide positive reaffirmation, reassurance about the role of the teams. Attempt to engage family. Inform family of legal obligations as part of treatment. 
5. Ethical dilemma: Parents may be guardians if Maria is significantly intellectually disabled. They may have the legal right to make decisions for Maria but if there is a significant risk of harm to Maria, the medical team has a duty of care towards Maria. Obtain emergency guardianship advice or medico legal advice. 
6. If Maria is experiencing delirium, then mental health act cannot be used and treatment will proceed under duty of care. If she is experiencing mental illness symptoms impacting on her safety mental health act may be needed.
7. Medication use in the context of behavioural disturbance should be a cautious use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines in small doses as organic brain disorders increase significant risks of NMS, paradoxical disinhibition and hence treatment should proceed on the medical ward. 
8. Involve clinical director and Nurse Unit Manager
 

Intellectual Disability, Schizophrenia and Epilepsy - Consultation Liaison 
The neurologist is happy for Maria to remain under her care as the risk of further seizures is quite high. However, the nursing ward staff have now become anxious about managing Maria on the neurology ward because they feel she is 'crazy' and may be a danger to the other sick patients. 
Question: Describe how you would address the nursing staff's concerns. 
1. Therapeutic alliance (Collaborator): Attempt to establish a therapeutic alliance with nursing staff. Provide encouragement, positive affirmation, acknowledge the difficult situation and offer support from mental health team.
 2. Psychoeducation to nursing staff (Educator): Explain that Maria is not ‘crazy’ but is experiencing a medical illness that may impact on her behaviour. The illness is treatable and that the condition may be life threatening and serious and hence monitoring on a medical ward is important.
3. Advise on management strategies for behavioural disturbance. (Clinician)
a. Environmental modification:
•	Provide a separate room
•	1 on 1 nursing (mental health nurse or general nurse)
•	Quiet area and avoid excessive stimulation
b. Medication intervention:
Avoid medication if not needed as organic disorder may increase the risk of side effects. Antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are indicated in aggression but have to be used cautiously in Maria as individuals with intellectual disability are susceptible to side effects such as EPSE, NMS and paradoxical disinhibition and therefore small doses will be required. Treatment of delirium is necessary.
c. Psychological strategies
•	Supportive counselling
•	Use audio visual aids in communication
•	Consistent nursing staff as much as possible
•	Involve family if supportive
•	Speak in soft voice and avoid jargon
•	Reorientation of room and other areas. (clear demarcation with signs)
4. Involve the C-L nurse to provide specific strategies on managing behavioural disturbance
5. Arranging ongoing reviews and case conferences with the neurology team to provide support. (Involve family; they may stay with her, bring food as she thinks food is poisoned. Address point of them coming from a small country town)
 
 
 
 

Opioid Assessment 
You are a psychiatric registrar working in the Drug and alcohol service. Rhonda is a 35 year old female with 3 children. She lives with her partner who is 37. She has a history of Drug and Alcohol misuse since the age of 19. She had been a heavy user of cannabis, alcohol, and heroin. She continues to use heroin which she buys off the streets.
Question: 
Describe your assessment of Rhonda
1. Risk assessment : Physical examination to rule out opioid intoxication. Confusion, pin point pupils, sedation. Pulse, BP and respiratory rate to rule out overdose. (Unconscious , Pinpoint pupils Slow, shallow respirations; respirations below 10 per minute Pulse rate below 40 per minute Overdose triad: apnea, coma, pinpoint pupils ) Risk of harm to children. Where are children currently? 
2. Interview approach : Non-judgemental attitude with reflective listening
3. Substance use history (Heroin and other substances): 
a. age of first use; substances used; change in effects over time; history of tolerance, overdose, withdrawal; attempts to quit; current problems with compulsivity or cravings. 
b. addiction treatment history; e.g., previous treatments for addiction, types of treatments tried, outcomes of treatment attempts, reasons for relapse. 
c. Mode of use, same dealer or different dealer, sharing needles, use on own or with other people, expenditure on heroin. 
4. Psychiatric history: Substance misuse is often co-morbid and on MSE I will look for :

•	Psychosis 
•	Eating disorders
•	Personality dysfunction: borderline traits
5. Family history : Family history of mental illness and substance use
6. Medical history : History of hepatitis B and C, vaccinations for Hep B and C, history of STD's and HIV. Heart disease such as pericarditis, endocarditis or valvular disease. 
7. Cognitive examination: Any frontal lobe deficits as can impede detoxification and rehabilitation attempts. 
8. Physical Examination:
•	Needle marks
•	Skin abscesses
•	Cellulitis
•	Jaundice
•	Poor nutrition and hygeine 
7. Psychosocial history:

Parenting capacity assessment 
You are contacted by the Department of human services to provide a report on Rhonda’s capacity to look after her children. 
List the key principles in approaching this request and what are the key components of a parenting assessment? 
1. Clarify request and obtain request in writing: The request can pose a dual agency dilemma as the role of a treating psychiatrist can conflict against one of an independent psychiatrist. Are you in the best position to write this report or should this be delegated to a psychiatrist familiar with family court. Discuss with director or senior colleague. 
2. Awareness that presence of a mental illness does not always indicate significant risk to the children
3. Confidentiality is overridden in cases where there is risk of harm to children and there is a duty to warn. 
4. Principles in gathering information
Information should be gathered from multiple sources e.g home visits, multiple assessments, observation, history, tests and rating scales. Children should be seen on their own and with parents and both parents should also be interviewed independently. Parent -child observation is important part of assessment. 
5. Assessment of child 
•	What proportion of time does the child spend with parent with mental illness? 
•	What is the nature of the child's attachment with parent ? Secure / insecure avoidant/ secure ambivalent / disorganised
•	Disruptions from parent
•	Child's experience of care
•	Age of child and developmental difficulties
•	What is child's understanding of parent's mental illness? 
6. Assessment of parent: 
•	Parent's ability to seek help
•	Child's physical and mental development
•	Impact of parent's disorder on child
•	Parent's ability to meet child's needs
•	Nature of parent's motivation and acceptance of responsibility
•	Quality of support available
•	Adequacy and effectiveness of current treatment
•	Symptoms of mental illness, substance use and insight 

History taking before starting Opioid replacement therapy

5.	Can the patient be expected to adhere to the treatment plan?
6.	Is the patient willing and able to follow safety procedures?
7.	Does the patient agree to treatment after a review of the options?
8.	Can the needed resources for the patient be provided (either on‐ or offsite)?
9.	Is the patient psychiatrically stable? Is the patient actively suicidal or homicidal; has he or she recently attempted suicide or homicide? Does the patient exhibit emotional, behavioral, or cognitive conditions that complicate treatment?
10.	Is the patient pregnant?
11.	Is the patient currently dependent on or abusing alcohol?
12.	Is the patient currently dependent on benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other sedative‐hypnotics?
13.	What is the patient’s risk for continued use or continued problems? Does the patient have a history of multiple previous treatments or relapses, or is the patient at high risk for relapse to opioid use? Is the patient using other drugs?
14.	Has the patient had prior adverse reactions to ORT
15.	Is the patient taking other medications that may interact with ORT?
16.	Does the patient have medical problems that are contraindications to ORT?
17.	Are there physical illnesses that complicate treatment?
18.	What kind of recovery environment does the patient have? Are the patient’s psychosocial circumstances sufficiently stable and supportive?
19.	What is the patient’s level of motivation? What stage of change characterises this patient?

Family planning and Opioid dependence 
6 months later, Rhonda is abstinent from heroin and wants to have another child with her partner. She is on a routine outpatient’s review and wants to know your opinion about having a baby. 
Outline the points will you cover during this interview?
1. Advise Rhonda that your role is not to offer relationship or family planning advice but to assist her in making an informed decision after explaining the risks and benefits.
2. Therapeutic alliance: Provide encouragement, validation and positive affirmation to Rhonda on her abstinence as part of motivational interviewing (maintenance phase)
3. Assess current mental state and social background: look for evidence of mental illness that could result in relapse of substance use
4. Assess for craving and compulsion to use
5. Assess psychosocial background : relationship, finances, supports in the recovery environment
6. Inform Rhonda about the risks of opioid use in pregnancy 
7. Inform Rhonda about the peri natal issues in pregnancy and risk of relapse of mental illness
8. Advice on involvement of specialist multidisciplinary drug and alcohol antenatal clinics. Such a multidisciplinary team typically would include midwives, obstetricians, paediatricians, perinatal psychiatrists, social workers, child protection workers and addiction specialists.
9. Close liaison with obstetrics team and peri-natal mental health teams
10. Choice of opioid in pregnancy in case of relapse would be methadone substitution therapy. 
11. Around delivery if on substitution therapy , admission would be preferable and post delivery monitoring of the baby due to the opioid withdrawal syndrome. 
12. Provide written information and invite partner to have another discussion. 
Key points : 
Substitution treatment is the preferred approach for the opioid dependent pregnant woman  due to its capacity to:
•	improve access to antenatal care with improved birth outcomes
•	reduce heroin and other drug use, and improve the health of pregnant women;
•	reduce maternal and infant deaths associated with heroin use;
•	reduce the spread of blood-borne communicable diseases associated with injecting drug use;
•	 facilitate the improvement in social functioning of the mother.
Although many women want to cease using opioids when they find out they are pregnant, opioid withdrawal is a high-risk option because a relapse to opioid use will expose both mother and child to the risks of unsanctioned drug use and affect the mother’s capacity to care for the child. Opioid substitution treatment has better outcomes, both in access to antenatal care and ongoing stability, than withdrawal during pregnancy
Although there is no strong evidence, it is widely accepted that withdrawal is not advisable prior to 14 weeks, or after the 32nd week of pregnancy (K. Kaltenbach, Berghella, & Finnegan, 1998; A. R. Lingford-Hughes, et al., 2012), due to the risk of inducing spontaneous abortion or premature labour. Relapse to opioid use during pregnancy can also result in poor obstetric outcomes. Opioid substitution treatment is thought to have minimal long-term developmental impacts on children when compared to the risk of uncontrolled opioid use during pregnancy and resulting harms (WHO, 2009).
Methadone and buprenorphine can both be considered first line options for the management of opioid dependence during pregnancy. Both medications are safe and effective during pregnancy for both mother and neonate. (National Drug Strategy, 2014)

MEQ 11.1 
A 41-year-old female presented to the emergency department found to be unconscious following an overdose. She has a past history of several presentations with deliberate self-harm. On medical work up it was found that she has atrial fibrillation too and was treated in a medical ward. 
 11.1. List the differential diagnoses
 Delirium (In this question it is important not to jump to conclusions. A patient with a medical overlap should always have delirium ruled out)
1.	The following are likely causes of delirium
•	Stroke
•	Pulmonary embolism
•	Haemorrhage including cerebral haemorrhage
•	Warfarin overdose (accidental or intentional)
•	Anti -arrhythmic overdose (prescribed for AF)
•	Drug and Alcohol Withdrawal or intoxication
1.	Depressive disorder with suicidal ideation
2.	Deliberate self harm as part of Borderline Personality Disorder
3.	You may add other causes that you think are likely but the key point is that despite a previous history of repeated self-harm one should still consider a hierarchical approach to evaluation.
	
MEQ 11.2
Q 11.2  The medical team decides that she needs to be treated with warfarin and they want your advice. What is your advice to the medical team? 
1.	Risk Benefit analysis: Risk of Warfarin prescription to be weighed against risk of pulmonary embolism, stroke or death if warfarin is not prescribed.
2.	Risk assessment: Suicidal ideation and Self harm ideation
3.	Can newer anticoagulants (e.g Xarelto) be prescribed which carry a lesser risk and in a restricted supply?
4.	If warfarin is to be prescribed then restricted supply to be considered with close INR monitoring
5.	Case management
6.	Possible daily prescribing by Assertive Outreach team

MEQ 11.3

She confirms that she does not use them while at work but uses only two tablets at night-time. She has no anxiety or depression. 
 12.1.        Describe your assessment
General Principles include the following: (Please adapt the answer according to the scenario)
1.	Risk Assessment : parenting assessment to assess for risk of harm to children (Neglect or direct risk of harm). Indirect risk such as easy access to medication. Risk of misuse or overuse of opioids or other substances. Doctor shopping.
 2.  Assessment of Pain

•	Motivational interviewing to determine where the patient is on the cycle of change (pre-contemplation to maintenance phase). Does she think the current use is problematic?
•	Psychosocial needs: relationships (husband and children), vocation, accommodation and finances.
•	Resilience and motivation to change along with psychological mindedness.
 

MEQ 12.2
12.2. Outline the key steps in management 
This question was mainly asked to test understanding of Opioid Therapy Agreement (These principles apply to Benzodiazepine and Stimulant use)
1.	Whilst dependence needs to be treated, it is important to recognise that abrupt stopping or forcing the patient to stop when they are not ready can lead to disengagement and diversion. (See Benzodiazepines in notes)
2.	Refer to a pain management specialist for optimum treatment of pain
3.	Motivational interviewing and building of therapeutic alliance
4.	Psychoeducation about the harmful effects of dependence to the patient
5.	A therapy agreement to be drawn up whilst patient continues to take medication prior to reduction and cessation
•	Patients should use their prescribed medication only as directed by the doctor
•	They will be unable to secure replacement medication if the script is lost or stolen
•	They agree to receive the medication from only one doctor
•	They will not receive additional medication if the prescription runs out early
•	They will accept generic brands of medication
•	If function has not improved after a negotiated length of time then the doctor has the right to taper the medication
•	They agree to submit urine and blood samples and agree to participate in all aspects of therapy for pain and psychiatric disorder if present.
•	They agree to use only one pharmacy to fill their prescriptions
•	They are to be responsible in managing their own appointments
 

MEQ 12.3
12.3. In one of her subsequent visits she tells you that her 7-year old daughter is showing anxiety and is clinging on to her. She is also rebellious and is showing argumentative and defiant behaviour. 
 List the possible contributory factors for this behaviour. 
1.	Genetic Anxiety Disorder
2.	Anxious temperament of child
3.	Environmental influences of the mother with anxiety: behavioural modelling)
4.	Separation Anxiety Disorder
5.	Early or traumatic separation from attachment figure (prolonged stay in hospital, sudden hospitalisation, death, divorce)
6.	Overprotective and needy parent leading to parentification of child i.e. unfulfilled dependency needs
7.	Learning disability
8.	Abuse (Emotional, physical or sexual)
9.	Pain and medical illness
10.	Secondary gain and abnormal illness behaviour
11.	Oppositional Defiant Disorder

MEQ 13.1
A 35-year-old migrant lady from India and mother of a child who is 5 was admitted to the ED following a seizure in a supermarket. Her husband works far away from home and comes home only on weekends. He is unsupportive of her and she has minimal social support. 
The emergency department assessment revealed that investigations are normal and medical registrar diagnoses this as a pseudoseizure and wants you to assess the lady. 
 13.1. Outline the approach to the assessment. 
There are many ways of answering this but the key points to remember are: 
1.	Do not assume that a pseudo-seizure diagnosis indicates absence of organic causes
2.	Cultural evaluation which includes cultural sensitivity
3.	Psychosocial issues predominate due to adjustment and losses secondary to migration.
 
•	Risk Assessment: Medical tests and examination to have medical causes ruled out. U and E (electrolyte disturbances), TFT’s, MRI or CT to rule out head injury or intracranial causes, EEG to rule out true seizures, Blood glucose to rule out hypo or hyper glycaemia.
•	Risk of harm to child: Are DHS involved. Where is the child currently?
•	Clarification of Seizure episode with medical registrar: Onset, duration and progress. Presence of emotional stressors or trauma. Pseudoseizures have a gradual onset; presence of emotional disturbances, no micturition or defecation, lasts for more than half an hour and EEG is normal
•	Psychiatric Evaluation: Elements of cross cultural assessment (covered during course) and involve a multicultural health worker or translator if required. The below is present in slides (issues for migrants).
•	Pre migration issues: personality, childhood, early childhood adjustment issues etc.
•	Migration issues: reasons for migration etc.
•	Post migration issues: Losses. Domestic violence, emotional and physical abuse. Features of depression, psychosis, mania and drug and alcohol misuse.
•	Past history of seizure and pseudo-seizures.
•	Medication history: Is she on anti epileptics?
•	Medical History: Diabetes, Hypertension. Medication history: e.g. insulin
•	Psychosocial Evaluation: Relationship stressors, Support with the child, Post natal depression after birth, Financial and accommodation stressors and Domestic violence
•	Cognitive and Physical Evaluation: Physical examination to rule out bruises taking into account gender and cultural sensitivity e.g. get a female chaperone or female doctor. Cognitive impairment to rule out delirium and sequelae of seizures or pseudoseizures.
•	Family meeting to assess for family dynamics and support available. Rule out stressors e.g. financial stressors
•	Cultural Aspects: Abuse may not be disclosed unless a confidential and private setting is provided. Involve cultural liaison if necessary. 
 

MEQ 13.2
13.2. Her husband calls angrily and says that she is acting out and does not have any medical grounds to be admitted. He wants her to be discharged home. 
How would you respond to the situation? 
This question is about foreseeability and knowing who to involve and why. 
 
Risk Management: 
•	If risk of aggression is present, call security.
•	Consider pacifying the husband and offer to have a meeting. Two people present and duress alarm in possession.
•	Psycho-education to husband about current condition: nature and treatment (write content depending on the question and diagnosis for patient)
•	Speak to patient and clarify situation. Ensure patient is free from undue influence in making decisions
•	Evaluate for domestic violence, physical or emotional abuse. Involve a female worker in assessment if necessary. Involve social worker
•	If evidence of domestic violence is present, police will need to be informed and DHS if risk to child is identified
•	If ongoing medical risk is present the patient will need to informed and treated under duty of care
•	If mental health issues are present and the issues pose a significant risk of harm to self-harm or others then a metal health act assessment should be considered.

MEQ 14.1
A 75-year-old female who was suffering from Parkinsonism for 15 years was admitted to change the batteries of her pacemaker. On the second day after changing the batteries she had become disoriented, experiencing visual hallucinations. She lives with her 80-year-old husband and was managed by the GP. You are called by the medical team to see this lady. She was on lorazepam nocte on a long-term basis but the medical team stopped her lorazepam.
 14.1. Describe your assessment of this lady with your differential diagnoses. 
The key points are following
 
1.	Risk assessment: Medical risk (physical illness), risk of harm to self, accidental self-injury or suicide and risk of harm to others. Where is the best place to evaluate and manage her?
2.	Setting: Consider safe setting e.g. 1: 1 special etc.
3.	Collateral information to obtain past psychiatric and medical history.State what you would like to know. E.g. medications, previous diagnosis, liaise with cardiologist
4.	Evaluation to rule out (State the most salient features to rule out the following: clinical and investigations)
•	Pacemaker syndrome
•	Delirium: Electrolyte disturbances, UTI, glucose abnormalities, Lorazepam withdrawal
•	Intracranial injury, stroke, PE, chest infection
•	Lewy Body Dementia
•	Psychosis with parkinsonism
•	Alcohol withdrawal
•	Epilepsy
1.	Cognitive and physical examination: Delirium or Dementia, neurological examination to rule out stroke, rigidity, myoclonus etc.
2.	Psychosocial Evaluation
 

MEQ 14.2
A 75-year-old female who was suffering from Parkinsonism for 15 years was admitted to change the batteries of her pacemaker. On the second day after changing the batteries she had become disoriented, experiencing visual hallucinations. She lives with her 80-year-old husband and was managed by the GP. You are called by the medical team to see this lady. She was on lorazepam nocte on a long-term basis but the medical team stopped her lorazepam.
 Describe your assessment of this lady with your differential diagnoses. 
See above question (Here you should weigh on organic issues as visual hallucinations are organic unless proven otherwise and delirium should always be excluded first. Note that visual hallucinations in individual with Parkinsonism may indicate Lewy Body Dementia)

MEQ 14.3
14.3. Write down your medication advice for the medical team. 
Main points
 Reinstate lorazepam if this was ceased suddenly
1.	Avoid antipsychotics or use extreme caution due to risk of severe rigidity, NMS or worsening of confusion.
2.	If antipsychotics are to be used, Quetiapine small dose with regular monitoring of Pulse, BP, Temperature and physical examination to exclude NMS
3.	Avoid anti-cholinergics as can worsen confusion
 

MEQ 14.4
14.4. The medical team decide to discharge her. What advice would you give to them before discharge? 
1.	Cognitive function: Is she delirious or is she stable?
2.	Has a meeting with family or carer been arranged?
3.	Occupational therapist to carry out functional assessment
4.	Physiotherapist to check for mobility and home assessment
5.	Assessment for Carer burden
6.	Referral to psychogeriatric team for follow up
7.	Case management
8.	Medication and use of aids to enhance compliance and prevent confusion e.g. dosette box

MEQ 15.1
A young man is brought to the emergency department on a hunger strike. He is physically debilitated when presented. He is in a cubicle with two other people in it. You are asked to see this patient?
 Q 15.1. List the ethical considerations in this case. 
Ethical considerations
1. Duty to act ethically.
Doctors must try to prevent coercion or maltreatment of detainees and must protest if it occurs.
2. Respect for autonomy.
Doctors should respect individuals' autonomy. This can involve difficult assessments, as hunger strikers' true wishes may not be as clear as they appear. Any decisions lack moral force if made involuntarily by use of threats, peer pressure or coercion. Hunger strikers should not be forcibly given treatment they refuse. Forced feeding contrary to an informed and voluntary refusal is unjustifiable. Artificial feeding with the hunger striker's explicit or implied consent is ethically acceptable.
3. 'Benefit' and 'harm'.
Physicians must exercise their skills and knowledge to benefit those they treat. This is the concept of 'beneficence', which is complemented by that of 'non-maleficence' or primum non nocere. These two concepts need to be in balance. 'Benefit' includes respecting individuals' wishes as well as promoting their welfare. Avoiding 'harm' means not only minimising damage to health but also not forcing treatment upon competent people nor coercing them to stop fasting. Beneficence does not necessarily involve prolonging life at all costs, irrespective of other values.
4. Dual Agency Dilemma. (This is particularly relevant when issues with detainees occur)
Acting in the patient’s best interest vs. Loyalty to the employing authority (e.g. Government). Clinical independence: Physicians must remain objective in their assessments and not allow third parties to influence their medical judgment. They must not allow themselves to be pressured to breach ethical principles, such as intervening medically for non-clinical reasons.
5. Confidentiality
The duty of confidentiality is important in building trust but it is not absolute. It can be overridden if non-disclosure seriously harms others. As with other patients, hunger strikers' confidentiality should be respected unless they agree to disclosure or unless information sharing is necessary to prevent serious harm. If individuals agree, their relatives and legal advisers should be kept informed of the situation.
6. Gaining trust.
Fostering trust between physicians and hunger strikers is often the key to achieving a resolution that both respects the rights of the hunger strikers and minimises harm to them. Gaining trust can create opportunities to resolve difficult situations. Trust is dependent upon physicians providing accurate advice and being frank with hunger strikers about the limitations of what they can and cannot do, including where they cannot guarantee confidentiality.
 
 
 
 

MEQ 15.2
15.2. Patient was given feeds and was medically stabilised after several weeks. The medical team inform you that they are going to discharge him.
What are the key points you would like to assess before discharging him? 
This question is based on the following: The question is at discharge stage so should be adapted accordingly but the general principles will help. 
 
GUIDELINES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF HUNGER STRIKERS
1.	Capacity to make decisions: 
This involves verifying that an individual intending to fast does not have a mental impairment that would seriously undermine the person's ability to make health care decisions. Individuals with seriously impaired mental capacity cannot be considered to be hunger strikers. They need to be given treatment for their mental health problems rather than allowed to fast in a manner that risks their health.
1.	As early as possible, physicians should acquire a detailed and accurate medical history of the person who is intending to fast. The medical implications of any existing conditions should be explained to the individual. Physicians should verify that hunger strikers understand the potential health consequences of fasting and forewarn them in plain language of the disadvantages. Physicians should also explain how damage to health could be minimised or delayed by, for example, increasing fluid intake. Since the person's decisions regarding a hunger strike can be momentous, ensuring full patient understanding of the medical consequences of fasting is critical. Consistent with best practices for informed consent in health care, the physician should ensure that the patient understands the information conveyed by asking the patient to repeat back what they understand.
2.	A thorough examination of the hunger striker should be made at the start of the fast. Management of future symptoms, including those unconnected to the fast, should be discussed with hunger strikers. Also, the person's values and wishes regarding medical treatment in the event of a prolonged fast should be noted.
3.	Sometimes hunger strikers accept an intravenous saline solution transfusion or other forms of medical treatment. A refusal to accept certain interventions must not prejudice any other aspect of the medical care, such as treatment of infections or of pain.
4.	Physicians should talk to hunger strikers in privacy and out of earshot of all other people, including other detainees. Clear communication is essential and, where necessary, interpreters unconnected to the detaining authorities should be available and they too must respect confidentiality.
5.	Physicians need to satisfy themselves that food or treatment refusal is the individual's voluntary choice. Hunger strikers should be protected from coercion. Physicians can often help to achieve this and should be aware that coercion may come from the peer group, the authorities or others, such as family members. Physicians or other health care personnel may not apply undue pressure of any sort on the hunger striker to suspend the strike. Treatment or care of the hunger striker must not be conditional upon suspension of the hunger strike.
6.	If a physician is unable for reasons of conscience to abide by a hunger striker's refusal of treatment or artificial feeding, the physician should make this clear at the outset and refer the hunger striker to another physician who is willing to abide by the hunger striker's refusal.
7.	Continuing communication between physician and hunger strikers is critical. Physicians should ascertain on a daily basis whether individuals wish to continue a hunger strike and what they want to be done when they are no longer able to communicate meaningfully. These findings must be appropriately recorded.
8.	When a physician takes over the case, the hunger striker may have already lost mental capacity so that there is no opportunity to discuss the individual's wishes regarding medical intervention to preserve life. Consideration needs to be given to any advance instructions made by the hunger striker. Advance refusals of treatment demand respect if they reflect the voluntary wish of the individual when competent. In custodial settings, the possibility of advance instructions having been made under pressure needs to be considered. Where physicians have serious doubts about the individual's intention, any instructions must be treated with great caution. If well informed and voluntarily made, however, advance instructions can only generally be overridden if they become invalid because the situation in which the decision was made has changed radically since the individual lost competence.
9.	If no discussion with the individual is possible and no advance instructions exist, physicians have to act in what they judge to be the person's best interests. This means considering the hunger strikers' previously expressed wishes, their personal and cultural values as well as their physical health. In the absence of any evidence of hunger strikers' former wishes, physicians should decide whether or not to provide feeding, without interference from third parties.
10.	Physicians may consider it justifiable to go against advance instructions refusing treatment because, for example, the refusal is thought to have been made under duress. If, after resuscitation and having regained their mental faculties, hunger strikers continue to reiterate their intention to fast, that decision should be respected. It is ethical to allow a determined hunger striker to die in dignity rather than submit that person to repeated interventions against his or her will.
11.	Artificial feeding can be ethically appropriate if competent hunger strikers agree to it. It can also be acceptable if incompetent individuals have left no unpressured advance instructions refusing it.
12.	Forcible feeding is never ethically acceptable. Even if intended to benefit, feeding accompanied by threats, coercion, force or use of physical restraints is a form of inhuman and degrading treatment. Equally unacceptable is the forced feeding of some detainees in order to intimidate or coerce other hunger strikers to stop fasting.
Other practical considerations: 
1.	Medical and Psychiatric evaluation before discharge
2.	Follow up: Case management
3.	Social worker to address issues of socio-political nature: Legal status
4.	Case conference to address dual agency dilemmag. patient may not have Medicare and hence may not receive care even though from an ethical point of view, one has to act in the best interest of the patient
5.	Collaborative Approach: NGO’s welfare groups, family involvement

MEQ 16.1
A 32-year old Caucasian female who lives with three children is referred to you for sleep disturbance. She says she has been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and is preoccupied with aches and pains in her joints. She says she is constantly tired during the day.
 16.1. Describe your assessment
Key points: All basic principles of approach discussed during course apply (e.g. risk, information gathering etc.)
1.	Exclude Psychiatric causes of fatigue: Depression, Somatic Symptoms Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Substance use (including benzodiazepine’s) Personality factors (this is important and emphasis should be given as the personality traits can often maintain the disorder)
2.	Rule out Sleep disorder
3.	Physical and Medical Causes of fatigue through physician involvement and investigations: Hypothyroidism, Addison’s disease, Iron deficiency Anaemia, UTI , Connective Tissue disease, Fibromyalgia etc.
4.	Chronic Fatigue Syndrome:
Fatigue with following features:
New or recent onset
Persistent or recurrent
Unexplained by other conditions
Reduction in activity
Post exertion malaise and fatigue
       AND one or more of following
Difficulty sleeping
Muscle and joint pain (multi site)
Headaches
Painful lymph nodes
Sore throat
Cognitive dysfunction
Flu like symptoms
 
1.	Medication history: pain medications, benzodiazepine treatment (often patients have dependence on substances)
2.	Cognitive and Physical exam: to exclude issues above
3.	Psychosocial history: 
Early childhood maladjustment
Role models with pain or abnormal illness behavior
Learned behavior i.e. physical pain as care eliciting behavior
Secondary gain: current stressors
Stressors with children and lack of psychosocial support

MEQ 16.2
You diagnose her with depression. She reports that she had a family history of bipolar affective disorder in her family. Her mother also had thyroid dysfunction. Growing up she was prone to infections and often spent several months in hospital for severe urinary tract infections. She missed school as a result. Her parents were critical of her and favoured her brother. Her mother was addicted to benzodiazepines and she described her mother as emotionally distant. She performed poorly at school and was below average. She was bullied at school for being overweight. She tells you that currently her pain and fatigue prevents her from going to work and that the only thing that gives her relief is Lorazepam.
16.2. Outline the key contributory factors to this patient’s depression providing justification from the vignette.
Such questions are about developing a Formulation: each factor mentioned has a link to the disorder based on your understanding of predisposing, precipitating and maintaining factors
1.	Family History: Genetic Predisposition towards an affective illness
2.	Family history of Thyroid dysfunction: Thyroid dysfunction can be a direct biological predisposing factor in fatigue and depression
3.	Repeated infections may be a sign of poor immunological function that can predispose her to later life fatigue
4.	Spending several months in hospital could have led to separation from care giver at early age leading to attachment difficulties which can lead to low self esteem through dysfunctional assumptions of self e.g. Being different fro other children, not able to develop peer relationships (Cognitive Model)
5.	Missing school: Impacting social skills and development of peer group relationships (Eriksonian model)
6.	Parental criticality: Development of low self-esteem and internalization of harsh critical parents setting up vulnerability for depression in later life (Cognitive and Psychodynamic Model)
7.	Mother addicted to Benzodiazepines: Role modeling of abnormal illness behavior i.e. maladaptive coping strategies (Abnormal illness behavior and Sick role)
8.	Emotionally distant mother: Alexithymia in family leading to decreased expression of emotions in family, which is a predisposing factor in somatoform illness and depression. It would also lead to attachment difficulties. (Attachment model)
9.	Poor school performance: Biologically it may represent a neurodevelopmental issue. Psychosocially would have impacted on self-esteem.
10.	Bullied at school for being overweight: Reinforcement of low self-esteem leading to core schema of self doubt, self loathing all of which are a predisposing factor for depression
11.	Pain and fatigue prevent her from going to work: This may be related to cognitive distortions about pain and function along a cognitive- behavioral model. Secondary gain may be present (Sick Role). 
12.	Lorazepam use: Cognitive distortion about lorazepam being the only medication that gives her relief. It may also indicate maladaptive coping strategies as a learned behavior from childhood
 

MEQ 17.1
A 25-year-old Caucasian female who is a known patient of the mental health team is 24 weeks pregnant and presents to you in crisis as she has an upcoming court case for custody of her 3-year-old child.
 17.1. List the key principles you would consider in management.  
Key points
 Risk assessment
Risk to self, unborn child and risk to 3-year-old child (Direct and indirect risk)
Involvements of Child Protection Services to assess further risks and explain to patient reason for involvement
Psychosocial support
1.	Attempt to engage the patient and build a therapeutic alliance. Explain that involvement of Mental heath services is to support her and her family and allay her fears that being mentally unwell will lead to her losing her children.
2.	Setting of management: 
Low threshold for admission in a safe and secure
environment if risks are identified with care arranged for younger child. Involve social worker.
1.	Specialist service involvement: Perinatal Mental health service
2.	Antenatal Care
3.	Case Conference to discuss management: GP, Psychiatric Team, Specialist services, Child Protection if involved, Social Worker, Psychologist, Obstetrics team
4.	Discuss with supervisor
5.	Liaison with court through court reports (if requested) after taking dual agency dilemma into account. Explain the dual agency dilemma.
6.	Psychiatric assessment for psychiatric disorders
7.	Parenting assessment 

MEQ 18.1
A Vietnam Veteran aged 67 presents to the emergency department late at night. The nursing staff call you to assess him as he has a ligature mark around his neck. On assessment he tells you that he was “ mucking about” and that he had no intention of dying. He smells of alcohol.
 18.1. List the key points in management 
Candidates are able to answer this question based on principles we discussed during course but some not to be missed points are as follows :
 
1.	Risk assessment: The situation should be taken seriously and a low threshold for admission should be considered due to discrepancy between the severity of attempt and the comment about “ mucking about”.
2.	Mental Health act vs. Duty of care. Management of risk if wanting to abscond (e.g. one on one special / security).
3.	Rule out Alcohol related disorders: Intoxication, withdrawal and cognitive impairment. So a medical evaluation is important and administer thiamine early.
4.	Assessment of PTSD and Co-morbidity: Depression, PTSD and Alcohol dependence are highly co-morbid. Patients can minimise the disorders hence a collateral in this case is very important.
5.	Adopt a dual diagnosis approach in management
6.	Recognise the barriers in management, which are likely to be an elderly male who may be stigmatised by mental health and therefore may not engage. So motivational interviewing, therapeutic alliance should be highlighted.
 

MEQ 19.1
You are a consultant psychiatrist in a community mental health team. The GP has referred Mandy, a 35-year-old Caucasian female with depressive symptoms for diagnostic clarification. Mandy’s brother died 3 months ago in a car crash.
 19.1. Outline the key differential diagnoses you would consider to assist the GP. 
This question was posed mainly to focus on the difference between Grief reaction and Depression
 Important points are as follows
 
1.	In grief predominant affect is of emptiness and loss
In depression, the predominant affect is a persistent depressed mood and inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure
1.	The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity over days and weeks and occurs in waves called pangs of grief. (These waves are associated with thoughts and reminders of deceased)
2.	Thought content of grief is preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased rather than self –critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in major depressive disorder.
3.	In grief self-esteem is preserved, in Major depression self-loathing and worthlessness is common.
4.	In grief the individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are focused on deceased and possibly joining the deceased. In Major Depression, suicidal thoughts are present because of feeling worthless and undeserving of life
 
 

MEQ 20.1
You are a Consultant Psychiatrist in the community mental health team. You are seeing Mr Smith a 34-year-old junior medical officer who has been referred by his director of training for psychiatric evaluation. The director of training tells you that the medical officer has appeared drowsy during the morning shifts and suspects addiction. 
 20.1. Outline your approach to management.  
Key principles
 Clarify your role: Role of a psychiatrist or colleague? You are responsible for patient safety and hence notification may be necessary irrespective of your role.
1.	Professional, legal and ethical obligations: Statutory Obligations that need to be followed.
2.	Duty to warn, especially if there is a risk to the patient. The primary concern is safety of the patient. If safety is a concern then doctor should be advised to take leave immediately.
3.	Maintaining privacy and confidentiality of the doctor and the limits that are imposed on this.
4.	Clinical Governance issues that include corporate risk. (Documentation and referral)
6.Management of the situation, which includes local interventions, external help and advice through professional bodies and support from the Registration Board. 
1.	In the case of a Psychiatrist who suspects an impaired doctor, he should first discuss this with his line manager.
2.	The line manager then assesses the situation, gathers evidence and passes that evidence on to the Director of Clinical Governance and further on to the Chief Executives.
3.	It is the Chief Executive’s responsibility to then make appropriate notifications to Registration Authority. (AHPRA)
4.	As mentioned earlier, it is important to keep the doctors under question, informed at all times and advise to seek legal advice, advice from his Medical Defence Union and Indemnity insurers as well.
5.	Health notifications must be made in writing and usually those providing notification to the Board must be aware that the doctor who is the subject of notification must, as a matter of natural justice, be given a copy of the notification and any additional material that is provided.
The following are the principles in managing a doctor with drug and alcohol issues:
Establishing dialogue
•	Who? It is usually better to have more than one person present when raising the issue of the problem of substance abuse. This helps to reinforce the gravity of the situation, allowing colleagues to show they are united and their wish to tackle the issue and help the impaired practitioner.
•	How? The impaired doctor is likely to feel defensive and ganged up on. Accordingly, concerns should be raised with sensitivity and in a non-judgmental manner but an expression of concern.
•	Why? It is better for the impaired doctor to know that the issue is in the open with colleagues and that they are united in their wish to tackle it and to help him/her.
•	When? The issue should be raised when the impaired doctor is not intoxicated and as soon as practicable after the event that has led to the suspicion of impairment.
•	Where? This should be done in a quiet and private place where interruptions are unlikely.
•	What? State the facts focusing on work performance (What happened, when it happened, who was involved). Do not assume anything about the cause, drug use may be one possible cause but the primary issue is work performance. Express concern about the doctor as well as patient safety.Anticipate anger, denial, alternative explanations and expression of competence.
•	Psychological assessment based on role: The following issues should be covered. 
Personal causes: 
•	Blues (depression)
•	Booze (alcohol)
•	Bi-lingual (language)
•	Babies (stressors)
•	Bank (financial stressors)
•	Birds/Blokes (relationship issues)
External or supervisor causes.
•	Lack of support
•	Lack of debriefing
•	Lack of orientation
•	No appraisal or feedback in place
•	Exams
•	Bullying or harassment
•	Unsupportive registrar
•	Nature of the work
System causes 
•	Poor rostering
•	Long hours
•	Stressful job
•	Funding issues within the service

Assessment of Attachment
 
Exam Question: 
Mary is a 36 year old married woman. Three months ago she gave birth to twins via emergency caesarean section, born at 26 weeks. Her son Dennis died. Her daughter Kym is in neonatal ICU on a respiratory ventilator. Mary has remained in hospital since the birth. Nursing staff say Mary is frequently tearful and criticises their care of Kym. Nursing staff have begun avoiding being assigned to Kym because of this.
Her husband James is an accountant who works long hours and visits for around an hour at a time. Her parents live near by but say they are reluctant to visit as they “cannot stand seeing the baby like that”.
•	Discuss HOW you would assess Mary’s attachment to Kym (Below is a generic attachment assessment. This can be adapted to the question. It is also suited if a parenting capacity attachment is asked)
1. Background:
Mary Ainsworth differentiated styles of attachment in infants. This research was based on the infants’ responses to separation from and reunion with their mother in an unfamiliar laboratory situation, known as the ‘Strange Situation’ (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters & Wall, 1978). 
The Strange Situation involved studying the communication between mother and child following 3 minute contrived separations. As a result of this research, Ainsworth grouped the patterns of attachment between infants and their carers into 3 main groups: ‘secure’, ‘insecure-avoidant’ or ‘insecure-ambivalent’.
2. Assessment of parents:
•	Any history of or current mental illness? : Children with depressed mothers are more likely to develop insecure attachments (Rutter, p. 558)
•	Have parents experienced any significant losses? : Children of parents with a history of loss and/or trauma are more inclined to form disorganised attachments 
•	Is there substance abuse? : Unpredictable or unreliable caregiving can also create attachment difficulties for children
•	Is there a history of or current domestic violence? : Children exposed to domestic violence are 4 times more likely to have attachment disorders
•	What is the parent’s capacity to reflect on the child’s experience? : Is it reality based? Sensitive? Flexible/accommodating?How does parent act on separation from the child?
•	How does parent act on reunion with the child?: Does she respond appropriately, in a timely manner?
3. Assessment of child (Depending on age): 
•	Any significant separations/disruptions from parents/primary carers? : Circumstances of the separation/disruption Why?
•	What was the quality of care received from primary carer? : For how long?
Who cared for the child?
•	What is the child’s experience of care?:  According to carers, child, family members, professionals, your own observations
•	Model of care
- Stable, reliable, unreliable?
What are the child’s expectations of being looked after? How does the child get his/her needs met?
How does the carer respond to the child?
•	How old is the child? 
•	What stage of development is he/she at? : < 6 months, 6-12 months, 1-2 years, 2-4 years, etc. Any developmental difficulties?
•	What is the nature of the child’s interaction with primary carer?
•	How does child relate to other adults?
•	How does child relate to other children?
•	How does child respond when separated from carer? Before, during, after (Refer to styles of attachment in diagram)
•	How does child respond when reunited with carer? Before, during, after (Refer to styles of attachment in diagram)
4. Who are the significant others in the child's life? 
5. Has the child been in an out of home placement?

Antidepressants and Breast Feeding
 
Q. You diagnose Mary with post-natal depression. She is expressing breast milk to bottle-feed, and is keen to continue this. Describe the content of your discussion with Mary and her husband regarding the use of antidepressants and breast feeding.
1. Risk benefit analysis to help the couple make an informed decision
2. Clarify concerns first
2. Breast feeding confers many advantages to mother and baby and is encouraged (e.g promotes bonding, enhances child immunity)
3. Impact of postnatal depression on mother and baby : Post natal depression can affect bonding, cognitive and emotional development of the baby. Therefore treatment of depression takes priority
4. Antidepressants that are safe during breast feeding are available and many have low passage into the breast milk. (Motherrisk)
5. Most antidepressants are excreted in low concentrations in breast milk, with few reaching 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. Paroxetine and sertraline produce low relative infant doses in the 0.5% to 3% range, while fluoxetine, venlafaxine, and citalopram produce milk levels closer to, and sometimes even above, the 10% limit
6. Alternative treatments for depression include CBT but may take time to act. 
7. Provide leaflets to read about risk
8. Arrange another appointment to clarify concerns. 
 


	
Staff management of Postnatal depression
Q. Nursing staff report Mary is difficult and ask your advise on how to handle her.
Discuss your response to this request
1. Listen and acknowledge difficulty in managing patient 
2. Provide positive affirmation and appreciation of their role 
3. Provide psycho education about postnatal depression: Symptoms include irritability, anger with psychodynamics mechanisms of acting out, projection and displacement. She would be particularly concerned about her young child who is in ICU. 
4. Environmental techniques: Calming environment, speak softly and listen, attempt to establish rapport, try to involve familiar staff and involve family
5. Psychological techniques: Provide supportive counselling, CBT, relaxation and mindfulness techniques
6. Medication only if situation escalates and mental state worsens or if patient requests it after risk benefit analysis.




Lithium and Pregnancy
A 35 year old female with an established diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder is on Lithium 900 mg note for the last 2 years. She has been stable with no relapses over the last 2 years. She attends your outpatient clinic and tells you that she has just come from her GP's rooms who sent her here as she is now 8 weeks pregnant. You have not seen her before. 
Outline your approach to the situation. 
1.Attitude to pregnancy: If she is wishing to continue or terminate. If wishing to terminate, assess mental state and capacity to do so. 
2. Risk-benefit analysis : Risk of stopping Lithium vs Risk of continuing Lithium treatment
3. Obtain background history from patient and reading notes: Severity of relapses, number of admissions, risk associated during relapses (suicide and harm to others). 
4. Explain to patient that your role will be explain all risks and benefits to help her make an informed decision. 
5. Offer to meet with husband or speak to husband at same time via teleconference. Important to involve her partner. 
6. Explain background risk of congenital malformations in pregnancy. 2-4% (NICE guidelines)
7. Explain risk of Lithium exposure in first trimester.
First trimester use of lithium is associated with an increase in cardiac defects, particularly Ebstein’s Anomaly which is increased from 1: 10-20,000 to 1: 1000. For this reason a high resolution ultrasound (foetal echocardiogram) will be carried out at 6 and 18 weeks. 
8. Stopping Lithium can pose a risk of relapse which can impact on the ability to self care and make decisions in the interest of the baby and self. Relapse can increase risk of harm to self and others. High chance of relapse which can be as high of 70% when stopped before conception. 
9. Close liaison with obstetrician, antenatal nurses and prenatal mental health team. Regular fetal ultrasounds

10. Provide leaflets with risks and benefits. Baseline risk and Absolute and relative risks of Lithium. 
11. If mother wants to stop the Lithium then gradual discontinuation with close follow up to detect relapse. 
12. Other aspects to take into account in pregnancy are:  
a. Changed renal clearance in pregnancy may require increasing the Lithium dose as pregnancy progresses. Lithium levels, renal and thyroid function need to be monitored regularly throughout the pregnancy. 
b. Due to risk of toxicity with rapid shift in maternal fluid volumes at pregnancy, the Lithium dose needs to be decreased 24-48 hours prior to a planned delivery, or ceased at the onset of spontaneous labour and recommenced at pre pregnancy levels after delivery.


	
Depression, ECT and Memory complaints
A 39 year old female with a 2 year history of depression has recently had a course of ECT (6 months ago). Over the last month she is complaining of worsening memory and slowing of her mind. 
Outline the key features in assessment that you would focus on to evaluate the memory complaints
1. Temporality of ECT and memory complaints : Did memory complaints start immediately after ECT or were they present prior?  
2. Temporality of depression and memory problems. Were memory complaints present prior to mood issues? 
3. Onset of first memory issues and mood issues
4. Type of ECT given: Bitemporal or Bifrontal or Right Unilateral. Were there any complications
5. Psychiatric history: Previous memory complaints during mood episodes,  Alcohol or substance use disorder, medication misuse (benzodiazepines, opioids etc.). Antipsychotics or sedative antidepressants or mood stabilisers. History of ADHD. 
6. Cognitive examination: Memory loss with ECT is usually associated with retrograde and anterograde amnesia,  autobiographical memory loss and loss of cognitive functions such as learning and attention) See here. Disorientation in Time, Place and Person indicates an organic possibility. Frontal lobe examination : Luria three step test, FAB etc. Other standardised test such as NUCOG. 
7. Medical history: Thyroid disease, Vitamin deficiencies, Iron deficiency anaemia, High Blood pressure which can be associated with vascular neurocognitive impairment, family history of neurodegenerative disease
8. Physical examination: Neurological examination: Cogwheel or lead pipe rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia (parkinsonism), Romberg's sign, motor weakness for evidence of TIA's. 
9. MRI scan and /or EEG done previously
10. Investigations: To rule out medical disorders listed above. 

Geriatric Psychiatry- Assessment Principles
Mr Alan Woods is a 64-year old male who is brought to the CMHT by his daughter due to a change in personality. His daughter reports that he has been doing odd things and has said inappropriate things to his grandchildren. 
Question: 
Describe your assessment with respect to establishing the diagnosis?
1. Risk assessment : 
a. Risk of harm to self : suicidal ideation / self harm ideation and accidental self harm
b. Risk of others: aggression
c. Risk to children: Clarify inappropriate things said. Is there evidence of physical or sexual abuse? Child protection may need to be involved if evidence of abuse is present. 
d. Risk of driving, wandering , risk to reputation
2. Background history : Who does he live with? Is he dependant in activities of daily living? What supports does he have? Who looks after finances, cooking, cleaning etc. 
3. Clarify situation through functional analysis : Onset, duration and progress of behaviour. If acute,  may indicate medical cause. Antecedents, behaviours and consequences. 
4. Medical history and medical evaluation: History of hypertension or diabetes for vascular dementia. Rule out Urinary tract infection, Thyroid dysfunction, electrolyte disturbance, medication history e.g. diuretics, anti-hypertensives can be associated with delirium. 
5. Evidence of delirium : sudden onset, reversal of sleep wake cycle, hallucinations or delusions, fluctuating cognition. 
6. Psychiatric History: Does he have a previous history of depression, mania or psychosis. Is he on medication? 
•	Rule out mania: sleep disturbance, excessive spending, euphoria, pressure of speech and tangentiality 
•	Has there been a personality change, apathy, disinhibition which can indicate cortical major neuro-cognitive impairment. Word finding difficulty can indicate Alzheimer's dementia. Sub-corticl dementia can be ruled out by presence f cog wheel rigidity, tremor, gait disturbance, primitive reflexes. Disinhibition usually indicates orbito-frontal lobe involvement. Lewy body dementia is differentiated by spontaneous features of parkinsonism and visual hallucinations
•	Assess for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) : wandering, incontinence, insomnia, aggression, sexual disinhibition. 
•	Substance use disorder: Alcohol use history which can present with intoxication or dementia from long standing use. 
7. Cognitive examination to rule out fronto-temporal dementia which can present with disinhibition. Tests include FAB, Luria-3 step, NUCOG, Clock Drawing test. MRI and SPECT to rule out dementia i.e atrophy of frontal or temporal lobes. 
8. Physical examination: neurological examination to rule out focal neurological deficit, rigidity, ataxia indicating subcortical involvement . Evidence of vascular disease, cardiovascular examination. Alcohol stigmata. 
9. Family history of neurodegenerative disease such as dementia, parkinsonism, early stroke, personality change and psychiatric disorder. 
10. Psychosocial environment: Finances (pension, capacity to make financial decisions, Enduring power of attorney), Relationships (assess for carer burden), Accommodation ( functional capacity with a functional assessment after acute situation has resolved). Capacity to make medical decisions for self.  

Geriatric Psychiatry - Genetic Testing Principles
You diagnose him with Alzheimer's dementia. His daughter tells you that she has read that dementia can be hereditary and wants to know if her family should be tested. 
What issues would you discuss? 
1. Acknowledge the sensitivity of the situation and provide support and clarify any questions she may have. 
2. Provide psychoeducation about general pros and cons of genetic testing
•	Genetic testing creates opportunities for the assessment of risk and diagnosis but there are important limitations. Not all genetic tests provide the information that families want and therefore can lead to uncertainties. e.g having a particular gene does not indicate the severity or the expression of the illness
•	Some conditions are not treatable therefore the question arises if family members should be tested for an untreatable disease
•	No test can detect a diagnosis with 100% sensitivity or specificity which means there are people that will incorrectly diagnosed as positive or negative. 
•	In some cases, genetic testing may limit the persons access to insurance.
•	Genetic testing may help with forward planning. 
•	Most of the risks associated with genetic testing involve possible emotional, social or financial consequences of the test results. You may feel sad, angry, frightened, depressed, anxious or guilty after learning your results. Learning that one carries a mutation in a gene that results in a progressive, lethal disorder can be devastating and should be considered very carefully.
On the other hand, test results can give you a sense of relief from uncertainty and help you make informed decisions about managing your health care. The test results might impact life decisions, such as career choice, family planning, or insurance coverage. Your genetic counselor can explain in detail the benefits, risks and limitations of a particular test. It is important that you understand and weigh these factors before making a decision.
 3. Specific information regarding Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease. 
Alzheimer's disease is divided into Early onset and Late onset Alzheimer's disease. Early onset Alzheimer's disease occurs in people aged 30-60. It is rare and accounts for less than 5% of all people that have Alzheimer's disease. Most cases of Early onset are inherited and therefore is known as Familial Alzheimer's disease. FAD is caused by mutations on genes 21, 14 and 1. A child whose mother or father carries a mutation for FAD has a 50-50 chance of inheriting that mutation. If the mutation is inherited the child will almost surely develop FAD. 
Late onset Alzheimer's occurs after 60 (her father). There is no one gene associated with this late form of disease. There are certain genes that can increase the risk of the disease and one such gene is the Apoe4 but having the gene does not mean one will surely develop the disease. A blood test exists to identify which Apoe allele a person has but it does not predict who will or will not develop the disease. 
4. If patient wants more specific advice refer to a genetic counsellor
5. Provide leaflets to read and arrange another meeting if necessary and involve other family members. 
Huntington's Disease
The mutant gene is situated on Chromosome 4 and in the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutant gene. If they inherit the gene they will surely develop huntington's disease. 
Fronto-temporal dementia: 
Mutations are found in 30–40% of cases with a positive family history. There are at least five genes associated with FTD and its subtypes. The microtubule associated protein tau gene (MAPT) was the first FTD gene identified in 1998 followed by the progranulin gene (GRN) in 2006. The MAPT and GRN mutations are variably found in some 10–20% of familial FTD series. FTDP-17 showing genetic linkage to chromosome 17, presents with a clinical syndrome of autosomal dominant disinhibition, dementia, parkinsonism, and amyotrophy.
Approximately 20-50% of individuals with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) have an affected first-degree-relative. Conversely, 50-80% of individuals appear to be the first person with FTD in the family, also called sporadic or nonfamilial FTD.Among individuals with FTD, approximately 10% have a change in a single gene (also called a mutation). Single gene causes for FTD are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the change and also developing the condition. Currently, changes in five genes have been associated with autosomal dominant FTD. It is possible additional genes will be identified in the future. Therefore, not finding a change in one of these genes does not reduce the risk for family members to zero. At this time, changes in the following five genes have been identified:
•	MAPT gene on chromosome 17 that makes the protein tau,
•	GRN gene, also called the PGRN gene, on chromosome 17 that makes progranulin protein,
•	TARDBP gene on chromosome 1 that produces trans-active response DNA-binding protein of 43-kDa molecular weight (TDP-43),
•	VCP gene on chromosome 9 that codes for valosin-containing protein and
•	CHMP2B gene on chromosome 3 that expresses charged multivesicular body protein 2B (also known as chromatin modifying protein 2B).
Mutations in the MAPT and GRN genes on chromosome 17 are the most common genetic causes of FTD. Clinical genetic testing for MAPT, GRN and VCP is available. Genetic testing is usually coordinated through a genetic counselor or other genetics professional following a genetic counseling appointment and detailed three-generation pedigree.Avoid jargon when writing in exam and explain what you would tell the patient.  

Capacity Assessment - Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry
A few months later Mr Woods has a fracture of his femur and is admitted to the surgical unit. After the operation, Mr Woods has developed gangrene of his foot. He refuses to have this operated. The surgeons call you to speak to Mr Woods. 
How would you manage the situation? 
1. Speak to the surgical team and clarify situation: What surgery is required, what are alternatives, seriousness and severity of the situation. 
2. Therapeutic alliance: Speak to Mr woods on his own and attempt to build a therapeutic alliance.Adopt a non-judgemental approach. Explain your role as a consolation-liaison doctor as patient may not want to talk to a psychiatrist
3. Explain the role of a capacity assessment to the patient 
4. Ethical dilemma: Autonomy of the patient vs. Duty of care. 
5. Components of capacity assessment : 
•	Does Mr Woods understand the purpose of the surgery and the consequences of not having surgery? Does he understand the risks and benefits of the surgery? 
•	Does Mr Woods understand the alternatives and the risks and benefits of alternatives?
•	Can Mr Woods weigh up the pros and cons of the situations and arrive at a balanced decision and what is the quality of the decision.
•	Can Mr Woods communicate the decision appropriately?
•	Is Mr Woods free from undue influence? e.g family
•	Is the decision consistent?  
6. If Mr Woods has capacity and refuses to have surgery then liaise with surgical team and provide ongoing support for Mr Woods. Sometimes the patient may change their decision as the situation deteriorates. Obtain advice from guardianship tribunal and obtain a second opinion. 
7. Provide audio-visual aids, involve family and consider religious and spiritual beliefs. 
8. Treat any mental illness present. In the context of mental illness if there is a risk of harm to self due to impaired capacity to make decisions then mental illness can be treated under the MHA. 
9. If he lacks capacity, then arrange case conference with surgical team and obtain second opinion. Speak to Guardianship tribunal as best practice. Proceed in the best interest of patient and with the least restrictive option. Take into account wishes of family and any advance directives.

Interpersonal Social Rhythm Therapy
Interpersonal Social Rhythm therapy is an evidence based treatment for bipolar disorder and is based on the relationship between life events and bipolar disorder taking into account the social zeitgeber theory. Zeitgeber is an external or environmental cue that affects the biological or circadian rhythms.
The articulation of the social zeitgeber theory led  to the development and testing of IPSRT (Frank, 2005), which integrates IPT for unipolar depression with a behavioural intervention that focuses on social rhythm and sleep/wake regulation.  In IPSRT, the clinician helps the patient recognise the relationship between disruptions in social rhythms and the onset of previous episodes and then uses standard behavioural techniques, including psychoeducation, self-monitoring, successive approximation, and reinforcement (via the observed link between   regular routines and improved mood), to facilitate and maintain increases in social rhythm and sleep/wake regularity. 
IPSRT addresses the interplay between the inter-personal and biological spheres by helping patients to see how interpersonal stressors and social role transitions can disrupt daily routines important to maintaining circadian integrity. As in IPT, therapists aid patients in resolving interpersonal disputes and negotiating role transitions. At the same time, they teach patients how to regularise irregular daily routines and how to maintain such regularity even in the face of external challenges.
Key principles: 
1) the reciprocal relationships between life stress
2) and the onset of mood disorder symptoms, the importance of maintaining regular daily rhythms and sleep–wake cycles, and
(3) the identification and management of potential precipitants of rhythm dysregulation, with special attention to interpersonal triggers. Therapists instruct patients to monitor their social routines and rhythms using the Social Rhythm Metric and, ideally, to begin to see the interplay among instabilities in daily routines, patterns of social stimulation, sleep/wake times, and mood fluctuations. IPSRT then implements behavioural strategies to help patients alter activities that promote rhythm irregularities (minimising overstimulation, monitoring the frequency and intensity of social interactions). Patients are encouraged to make life changes in order to protect the integrity of their circadian rhythms and sleep/wake cycles.

Intellectual Disability : Approach to Assessment
John is a 22-year-old male with Down’s syndrome who lives in a residential home for people with learning difficulties. You are a psychiatric registrar working in the emergency department. The ED registrar refers John’s case to you after John was verbally and physically aggressive to staff in the residential home. The staff refuse to have him at the home until his behaviour has settled. 
Question 6
Outline your approach to the assessment. 

Note similarities with Geriatric Psychiatry Assessment in Neurocognitive impairment. This answer focuses on the main principles so apply it to the patient in the question to make it non-generic. 
1.Ensure John's safety priory to assessment : 1 on 1 special to avoid risk of harm to self or others and absconding. 
2. Speak to staff and clarify situation: Onset, duration and progress of behaviour. Was this a single incident or a pattern is evident? Functional Analysis (Antecedents, Behaviours and Consequences). Identify the key worker with whom John has known the longest or has best therapeutic relationship. 
3. Assessment of baseline environment and psychosocial functioning of the patient: Number of residents, male-female ratio, number of staff, 24 hour residential or Day time support, medication supervision, Shift schedule, usual activities in the group home, age group of patients.
4. Assessment of communication skills of patient (Pre-symbolic, Symbolic or verbal), Cognitive and social functioning: Does he cook , clean , self hygiene or is he dependant on others for activities of daily living? 
5. Preparation in advance before seeing patient : Informant rated interview schedule such as Mini PAS-ADD ahead of interview with main carer. Allow longer time with patient, avoid interruptions, use pictures, leaflets and audio-visual aids such as Books beyond Words (Hollins, 2010). 
6. Approach to interview with patient : Closed questioning may be problematic as they may give responses that the questioner is expecting or may repeat the last choice. Open questioning may also cause problems as they require the person to think and the retain a number of possible answers whilst at the same time having to structure their response in a certain way. 
Questions should be broken down into small chunks, and check understanding. Use simple, short sentences with everyday words and avoid jargon. Use pictures, photographs, facial expressions and tone of voice to facilitate communication. Give time to formulate a response and allow for mild inappropriateness and be flexible. 
7. Assess for Causes of behavioural disturbance: 
a. Medical Causes: Constipation, Urinary tract infection, ear ache, respiratory infections. dental pain, headache (Menstruation in females), headache. Onset of early Alzheimer's in Down's. Thyroid dysfunction and epilepsy. Electrolyte abnormalities. 
(b. Behavioural phenotypes: Does the patient have a diagnosis of Prader Willi Syndrome/ Lesch Nyhan or Fragile X syndrome ) if the diagnosis is not given. Here it is Down's syndrome. 
c. Environmental causes: Distress, change in routine, change in carer or residents, bereavement 
d. Behaviour serving a function (secondary reinforcement) : To gain attention from carers, to avoid chores or activities, to obtain tangibles, to avoid boredom. 
e. Psychiatric Causes: The diagnosis of mental illness in individuals with intellectual disability is challenging because the presentations occur atypically. Therefore misdiagnosis can occur and is known as diagnostic overshadowing. Longitudinal observation in a safe place may be necessary to note diagnosis. Change in sleep wake cycle, fluctuating cognition may indicate delirium, suspiciousness or attention to invisible stimuli may indicate psychosis or epilepsy related syndromes, tearfulness or withdrawal may indicate depression and disinhibited behaviour may indicate affective syndromes. Decline in functioning may indicate neurocognitive impairment and a scan may be required. 

Intellectual Disability : Management principles in behavioural disturbance
John‘s behaviour settled and he went to the residential home. The staff ask for particular strategies to manage John’s behaviour when he gets aggressive.
Outline the key points would you cover in your discussion?
1. Recognise and acknowledge difficulty in management and be sensitive to the carer. Provide positive affirmation and offer support. 
2. Clear advice on risk management: If significant risk of harm to the patient or others then crisis team or police may need to be informed first. Provide appropriate numbers. 
3. Advice on functional analysis and maintaining a diary to note, antecedents, behaviours, consequences with times. This can help detect a pattern. 
4. Practical strategies for staff about interviewing techniques: See previous question. 
Make individual as comfortable as possible, identify familiar caregiver, encourage use of comforting objects, quiet spot, use gestures, soft voice, warmth, simple words and avoid jargon. 
5. Advice on causes of behavioural disturbance : previous question
6. Advice on management of behavioural disturbance: 
a. Environmental techniques : de-escalation, time out, one on one supervision
b. Psychological techniques: functional analysis, Using positive reinforcement, avoid punishment
c. Pharmacological: low dose antipsychotics and benzodiazepines taking into account susceptibility to side effects
7. Support for care giver: respite, staffing issues and ability to raise concerns. 

Intellectual Disability - Relationships and Ethical Dilemmas
John has developed a relationship with a 24 year old female in the nursing home? The staff are concerned and so are John’s parents. The staff want to discuss this with you.
What are the main issues to be addressed in this situation?
1. Ethical issue: Autonomy and privacy of the patient vs. duty to protect vulnerable individuals. Consumers have a right to express sexual freedom and is a key tenet of the recovery model. It is important at the same time that consumers are not exploited or harmed in anyway because they are unable to make appropriate decisions. 
2. Refer to nursing home policy and speak to clinical director. 
3. Speak to the mental health team of the 24 yr old female and advise of the situation. 
4. Independent capacity assessments to be carried out by the respective teams. 
5. Sexual education to provided to both parties independently so that they are able to make informed decisions; Seek advice from local sexual health teams. : Education about anatomy and biology, education about what constitutes a normal relationship and sexual act. Family planning and contraception. Use audio visual aids, pictures, books and check understanding. Avoid jargon. 
6. Assess capacity to consent to relationship (Both teams separately) : 
•	What is the nature of the relationship? 
•	Why does he or she want to have a relationship. 
•	Does the person know it is wrong to force someone to have sex? 
•	Does the person understand that the extent of a sexual relationship is guided by mutual enjoyment? 
•	How does the person consent and what is the nature of these choices? 
•	Is there a power imbalance in the relationship? 
•	Is consent free from undue influence and is there consistency in the decision making? 
•	Is the person able to weigh the pros and cons of the decision? 
7. Arrange a meeting with family with clinical director and explain the issue after obtaining consent from the patient. 
8. Seek legal advice if the patient lacks capacity e.g guardianship bodies, medico legal insurance. 


















	
Assessment of Risk - Stalking 
Jane is a 35 year old nurse working in an in patient unit where you work as the psychiatric registrar. Steven is a 35 year old male who presents to the reception of the in patient unit demanding to see Jane. He claims that he is in love with her and wants to see her immediately. He seems agitated. Jane reports to you that she does not know him and he has been following her lately. She mentions that he has been an inpatient on the unit 3 months ago. 
Question: Describe your assessment and what are the key features you would like to focus on with a view to diagnosis
1. Risk management: Inform security. Ensure safety of staff . Duress alarm. Ensure adequate means of escape present. Inform NUM. Security to search for weapons. Attempt to establish rapport whilst being cautious not to aggravate the situation. Inform police depending on level of threat. It is often safer to call for help early and to remain at a safe distance until support, such as police and ambulance, arrives. A show of support from other agencies may persuade the patient to cooperate.
2.  Approach to patient and management of aggression or agitation: (The detail depends on the number of marks. This can be asked as a separate question. Divide the management into environmental, medication and psychological techniques)
•	Use an empathic non-confrontational approach, but set boundaries
•	Listen to the patient, but avoid giving opinions on issues and grievances beyond your control
•	Offer food, drink and a place to sit
•	Avoid excessive stimulation
•	Avoid aggressive postures and prolonged eye contact
•	Recruit family, friends, case managers to help
•	Address medical issues especially pain and discomfort
•	Try to ascertain what the patient actually wants and the level of urgency
•	Offer oral medication
•	In severe cases of agitation or aggression, the mental health act may need to be used. (While there are state by state differences in the Mental Health Act the principles are very similar. When involuntary care is needed, an initial schedule is written to allow safe care and transport to a mental health unit (this may be an emergency department, psychiatric unit or hospital). It should be remembered that in some jurisdictions a Mental Health Schedule can now be written by police and ambulance officers as well as by a doctor, and that it is a legal order that a patient be taken to a place where they can be assessed by a mental health specialist. If there is a potentially serious medical emergency it may be necessary to provide treatment without immediate scheduling of an uncooperative patient. Restraint and forced sedation should be considered a last resort.)
•	IM medication and seclusion may be needed depending on level of threat. Monitor patient's physical state (T,P, RR , O2 sats after IM injections )
2. Review previous notes to assess for diagnosis and risk: Does he have a psychotic disorder and are there any forensic convictions or risk of harm to self or others previously? Does he have a case manager. Is he on an involuntary order. Medications such as oral or depot medications? Past aggressive behaviour, severity, use/possession of weapons , Past threats, recent threats. Substance abuse, Past impulsivity, Poor psychosocial supports, Recent severe stress, loss, threat of loss, Past indications/diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder
3. Assess mental state:  Evidence of delirium , organic causes (hypoglycaemia, substance withdrawal, head injury, seizure activity etc. ) Evidence of psychosis , substance misuse , mania , erotomanic features.
•	Intoxicated
•	Cognitively impaired
•	Psychotic and/or manic
•	Delusions or hallucinations focussed on a particular person • Command hallucinations
•	Preoccupation with violent fantasy
•	Delusions of control (especially with violent themes)
•	Agitation, excitement, hostile, suspicious
•	Frustrated, angry
•	Pacing, yelling, not cooperating
•	Medical – pain, acutely unwell
4.  Establish stalking behaviour :
•	Unwanted contacts, including following, approaches and surveillance
•	Unwanted communications, including telephone calls, e-mails, letters and graffiti
•	5. Associated risk with stalking :
•	Threats
•	Assault
•	Ordering or cancelling goods or services on the victim's behalf
•	Sending unsolicited gifts
•	Initiating spurious legal actions
•	Making vexatious complaints
•	6. Risk assessment related to stalking : Use relevant components of the HCR-20. 
•	7. Establish type of stalker:
•	The rejected who pursue ex-intimates, either in the hope of reconciliation, or for vengeance, or out of a mixture of both
•	Intimacy seekers who stalk someone they believe they love and who they think will reciprocate
•	Incompetent suitors who inapprpriately intrude on someone, usually seeking a date or brief sexual encounter
•	The resentful who pursue victims to exact revenge for some actual or perceived injury
•	The predatory whose stalking forms part of sexual offending
•	8. Duty to warn third party e.g nurse of risk of harm is evident. 

Risk factors for Violence or Aggression 
The HCR-20 can be used OR the following
Static Factors: 
•	Age
•	Gender
•	Ethnicity
•	Intellectual disability
•	Social class
•	Educational level
•	Developmental trauma
•	Criminal history
•	History of previous dangerousness
Dynamic and Stable 
•	Treatment non- responsiveness
•	Personality
•	Interpersonal support network
•	Impulsivity
•	Problem solving capacity
•	Cognitive schema
•	Attribution style
•	Attachment style
•	Immature or primitive psychological defences
Dynamic and Changeable
•	Psychotic symptoms
•	Mood or anxiety symptoms
•	Substance use 
•	Acute crisis 
•	Social isolation 
•	Unsatisfactory living situation 
•	Treatment non-adherence
As you can see you can expand on some of the above to get more factors. 

Key Points in Severe Aggressive Behaviour
•	These disturbances are the most severe, characterised by actual physical aggression or
assaultive behaviour.
•	Such patients are often severely distressed by psychotic symptoms or disinhibited by alcohol or other drugs. These instances represent psychiatric emergencies and warrant management including use of physical restraint, seclusion, the administration of parenteral psychotropic medication and the appropriate level of monitoring.
•	The safe restraint of such patients, to protect both staff and the patient from injury, requires special training.
•	Psychotropic medication administered parenterally, particularly when benzodiazepines are combined with antipsychotic medications, may be unpredictable in their effects.
•	Seemingly small doses can lead to catastrophic complications such as upper airway collapse or respiratory arrest. As such, parenteral psychotropic treatment should only be used when adequate resuscitation facilities are available.
•	The patient must be monitored for signs of cardiovascular instability, oxygen desaturation and airway protection. 
•	The circumstances of seclusion or administration of emergency parenteral antipsychotic medication require careful documentation in both the patient’s chart and a formal ‘seclusion register’. 





Stalking and Psychosis - Management
You have diagnosed Steven with psychosis and want to admit him. There are no other beds available and he will need to be admitted on the ward of the local hospital. Jane, the nurse will be working double shifts for the next week. 
Outline your immediate management plan. 
1. Duty of care towards patient vs Duty to protect staff. 
2. If risk of harm to staff has been identified, duty to warn the staff member. Clarify Jane's thoughts of the situation. 
2. Assess for nature of psychosis and if the delusional system involves Jane e.g erotomania, persecutory delusion related to Jane. 
3. If delusional system involves Jane, then there can be a serious risk of harm towards Jane. 
4. Inform clinical director and NUM. 
5. Contact bed manager and stress importance of situation. 
6. Admission in another location 
7. Change of Jane's working environment e.g in community OR Time off with pay. 
8. Support for Jane : Counselling and occupational health. 
9. Treatment of Steven's psychosis. 

	
Stalking - Management of Victim
Jane the inpatient nurse has been 'traumatised' by the overall experience and comes to you for advice. She reports feeling constantly on edge and believes this is affecting her work. She tells you that she has developed a dislike for young male patients on the ward. 
List the key issues in management 
1. Clarify your role (Professional): Are you the treating doctor or a colleague? Explain the if there are performance issues that may impact on patient care then you have an obligation to report. 
2. Support for a colleague (Manager): Be supportive, express empathy, provide advice on avenues for Jane to obtain support : OHS, NUM, Supervisor, insurance etc. Work place has an obligation to provide a safe and supportive place for the employee. 
3. Assess for any risk of harm to patients : Is the nurse unable to perform due to her situation and is this impacting on patient care? If this is the case then inform NUM and Clinical Director as reporting obligations to regulatory body would be important. 
4. Independent psychiatric assessment to rule out PTSD, Adjustment disorder or onset of depression that may impact on her work to be arranged by work place. 
5. Referral for supportive counselling, psychology and time off. 
6. Counselling to address psychodynamic issues of transference and countertransference developed through the traumatic experience. 
7. Support for Jane: There is an obligation for work place to act in the best interest of the employee. 
•	Safe and confidential therapeutic setting
•	Education and supportive counselling
•	Cognitive–behavioural therapies for anxiety and avoidance
•	Pharmacotherapy for psychiatric and physical morbidity
•	Substance misuse counselling
•	Family and partner counselling
•	Support groups
•	Support organisations

Paraphilias - Assessment 
 
Principles in evaluation: 
1. Demographic characteristics: 
age, gender, current and past marital status, number of children (age and gender if any), current and past employment status (with or without children), education level;
2. Clinical Characteristics: 
•	conventional and paraphiliac sexual fantasies and activity (frequency and type), exclusive or non exclusive paraphiliac behaviour, age at onset of paraphiliac behaviour, type and number of paraphilia, gender and age of victims, intra familial or not (known or unknown victim), internet use or video use, violence, previous convictions for sexual or non-sexual offences, family and personal history of sexual disorders, previous treatments. 
•	for sexual offending and compliance, alcohol or illicit drug consumption before paraphiliac sexual behaviour, age of puberty. 
3. Risk factors: 
•	Personal history of psychiatric disorders, suicide attempts, history of brain trauma, current dementia, previous or current psychiatric or non-psychiatric diseases and treatment, previous history of sexual abuse or use of violence
•	Family history of paraphilias, drug or alcohol misuse and psychiatric disorders. 
4. Stage of Change and readiness for treatment: 
•	victim empathy, coping with stress, impulsivity, interpersonal relationships, insight, motivation for treatment, cognitive distorsions, denial, degree of mental retardation if any. 
5. Diagnosis of paraphilia. 
Number and type of paraphilias; comorbidity with axis 1 or axis 2 of the DSM classification (especially addictive disorders or personality disorders); comorbidity with somatic diseases if any; cognitive evaluation if mental retardation or dementia; careful medical examination, blood measurements and/or plasma hormone levels if hormonal treatment is needed. Baseline osteodensitometry could be necessary in case of hormonal treatment.
 





	
Paraphilias : Treatment
Psychological Treatment: 
1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
Applying behavioral therapy techniques to modify sexual deviations by altering patients’ distorted thinking patterns and making them cognizant of the irrational justifications that lead to their undesirable sexual behaviors. It may be employed in accordance with a 7-step approach, as follows:
•	Aversive conditioning with ammonia or (masturbatory) satiation
•	Confrontation of cognitive distortions (especially effective in groups)
•	Victim empathy (showing videos of victims and the consequences they experience from the patient’s act)
•	Assertiveness training (including social skills training, time management, and structuring)
•	Relapse prevention (identifying antecedents to the behavior [high-risk situations] and ways of disrupting these antecedents)
•	Surveillance systems (family associates who help monitor patient behaviour)
•	Lifelong maintenance
One can also use sexual impulse control and biofeedback along with above. 
2. Orgasmic reconditioning: By using masturbation, recondition the patient to orgasm to a more acceptable stimulus. 
3. Social Skills Training : Sexual education, developing intimacy, carrying on conversations with others, and assertive skills training. 
4. Group therapy and psychodynamic therapy. 
Pharmacological Treatment: 
•	Antidepressants, such as lithium and various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
•	Long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormones (ie, medical castration), such as leuprolide acetate and triptorelin
•	Antiandrogens (to lower sex drive), such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (10 mg q12hr, with the dosage doubled every 3 days to a maximum of 200 mg/day, then maintained for 1 month and adjusted as necessary)
•	Phenothiazines, such as fluphenazine
•	Mood stabilisers
Surgical Treatment: Bilateral orchidectomy
Ethical issues arise in surgical and medication treatment. 
The major ethical issues regarding sex offenders including paraphilias may reflect the need for public safety balanced against the public and even professional orientation towards punishment rather than treatment even where treatment is appropriate and effective. 

Pathological Gambling - Assessment 
1. Detailed assessment of gambling behaviour:
•	initiation
•	progression
•	current frequency (days per week or hours per day)
•	current severity (money spent on gambling proportionate to income)
•	types of games played
•	maintaining factors
•	features of dependence
2. Diagnosis of Pathological Gambling:
•	Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement.
•	Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling.
•	Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling.
•	Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble).
•	Often gambles when feeling distressed.
•	After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (“chasing” one’s losses).
•	Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling.
•	Has jeopardised or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling.
•	Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling.
3. Consequences: financial, interpersonal, vocational, social and legal
4. Reasons for consultation, motivation to change and expectations of treatment
5. Assessment of suicide risk
6. Assessment of Axis I and II comorbidity, including substance use disorders
7. Comprehensive mental state examination to rule out mania, depression, OCD 
8. Questionnaire's : 
•	The South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS; Lesieur & Blume, 1987)
•	The Lie/Bet Questionnaire (Johnson et al, 1997)
•	Gamblers Anonymous’s Twenty Questions (the GA–20; Gamblers Anonymous, 2005)
General Points:
Aetiological models in gambling 
•	Psychoanalytic (unconscious desire to lose, unresolved Oedipial conflicts)
•	Learning theories (monetary gain and excitement acting as positive reinforcers)
•	Cognitive theories (cognitive distortions such as magnification of one’s gambling skills, superstitious beliefs, interpretive biases)
•	Neurotransmitter theories (serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine dysfunction).


	
Pathological Gambling - Management 
1. Pharmacological Treatment: 
a. SSRI : all SSRI's have shown to be better than placebo
b. Naltrexone: 
μ-opioid receptor antagonist, is effective in the treatment of a range of impulsive behaviours/disorders such as kleptomania, self-injurious behaviours and borderline personality disorder. It is also useful in reducing high-urge and craving states in people dependent on alcohol and heroin. Naltrexone’s predominant mechanism of action is via the modulation of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway involved in reward and reinforcement.
c. Mood stabilisers particularly Lithium in patients with and without bipolar disorder
2. Psychological Therapy: 
a. Behavioural therapy: Aversion therapy, imaginal desensitisation, imaginal relaxation, behavioural monitoring, covert sensitisation and spousal contingency contracting.
b. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy:
Other treatments often incorporated in cognitive–behavioural packages include training in assertiveness, problem-solving, social skills, relapse prevention and relaxation.
c. Gamblers Anonymous






	
Assessment of Attempted Suicide and Deliberate Self Harm
Assessment of attempted suicide and DSH 
1.  Build Rapport 
A patient who is being seen following self-harm or for the assessment of suicidal intent may be distressed, embarrassed or guarded and, therefore, maybe reluctant to engage or cooperate with history taking. However, patients are often relieved by the unburdening of their troubles rather than being annoyed or offended. 
2. Psychiatric History 
Approach to the history : Open and direct manner without ambiguity so that mistakes are not made. Introduce questions regarding suicide in a sequential manner. For example, starting with “With all these problems that you are now facing, have you ever thought that you would rather be dead?” If an affirmative answer is given then it could be asked “Have you ever thought about deliberately ending your life?”, then “Have you thought about how you might do this?” It is often useful to run through a chronological description of the events leading up to, during and after the self-harm or suicide attempt to asses the level of risk.
Key points to cover : 
a) prior to self-harm:
•	Significant acute psychosocial stressors (possible precipitating factors) or medical problems
•	Low mood or symptoms of a major mental illness
•	Feelings of being better off dead
•	Feelings of hopelessness
•	Drug or alcohol consumption
•	Preparation for death; finalising will or life insurance, giving away possessions, writing a suicide note
•	Onset of suicidal ideation
•	Degree of planning (versus impulsivity)
•	The patient’s perception of the degree of lethality of the chosen means patient may strongly believe that five sleeping tablets would be lethal in overdose) and the patient’s intent (e.g. to die, to escape problems, to sleep)
b) events at the time of the suicidal act:
•	The setting; where they at home with family around them or did they attempt suicide away from home or at a time when they knew no one would be around
•	Was the patient intoxicated?
•	Acute stress present? (e.g. argument with partner)
c) post self-harm:
•	Are they glad or disappointed that they are alive?
•	Does the patient show remorse or regret about the attempt? (Shame or regret may be a good or bad thing: some patients will regret the hurt that loved ones may have felt and be less inclined to attempt suicide in the future; a person with low self-esteem may feel even more of a burden or worthless and therefore more determined to carry out further attempts)
•	Actions or behaviour after self-harm or suicide attempt (e.g. immediately called someone for help or tried to hide the attempt from others)
•	Continued access to suicidal means (e.g. does the security guard who presents after self-harm have access to a gun?)
•	Willingness to engage with mental health services and accept treatment
•	Ongoing or future suicidal intent or plans
•	Plans for the future? Do they express plans to see friends, keep appointments or to try to obtain goals in the future?
•	What supports are available in the community?
•	Has the self-harm served a purpose or helped out the patient in someway (e.g. release of frustration, mobilised the support of loved-ones) that may result in a reduction of risk?
•	If the patient denies further suicidal intent or plan following an attempt, what has changed? (e.g. an acute stressor has passed, they have come to a realisation that they are loved or that their death would be more significantly felt by others than they previously thought, social supports generated etc.) If there doesn’t appear to be any change in the patient’s situation following a serious suicide attempt but the patient is denying further suicidal intent then consideration should be given to whether the patient is being deliberately deceptive.
•	Look for discrepancies in the recall of events that may indicate that the patient is being deceptive (e.g. a patient may present after an ‘accidental’ injury or overdose in the context of significant psychosocial stressors and have significant risk factors for suicide but denies suicidal ideation or intent) Consider suicidal intent in a patient that has been involved in uncharacteristic risk-taking behaviour; a patient presents obtunded after taking a large amount of benzodiazepines but upon awakening say that their intent was just to get some sleep.
•	The ability of the patient to guarantee their safety is not a reliable measure of risk.
3. Past psychiatric history: 
•	Ask about previous suicide attempts; the psychosocial context in which they occurred, the method used, degree of intent and lethality and treatment sought or provided
•	Patient’s ability to engage with treating professionals or teams
•	Presence or absence of diagnosed mental illness or personality disorder
4. Collateral History: Obtain collateral history from past medical files, family, friends, general practitioner, treating psychiatrist or psychologist, or community mental health team
Issues of privacy and confidentiality must be weighed against the level of risk; if the patient does not give consent to talk to third parties, then confidentiality may be broken if it is felt that the level of risk to the patient (or others) outweighs the patient’s right to privacy; a judgement may also need to be made about whether there is enough concern to risk jeopardising the therapeutic alliance from contradicting the patient’s wishes.
5. Medical/ Physical Assessment:
•	Consider a paracetamol level and other drug screen after self-harm as a routine (not all patients are reliable historians), if the medications ingested are unknown or if there has been a suspected polypharmacy overdose
•	Consider a longer period of medical observation for medications with unusual metabolism or those that are slow release
•	Patients who are intoxicated with alcohol or other substances may need to be detained in hospital and observed until they are sober so that a more thorough risk assessment can be undertaken
•	Assessment of cognitive function may be important as part of an assessment capacity if the patient is requesting to leave or to detect ongoing cognitive side effects of ingested substances.

Management Principles - Attempted Self harm and Suicide
1. Risk management: 
•	Sedative medication may be required to reduce distress or reduce risk of harmful behaviour
•	1:1 nurse special, security, police depending on level of threat. 
•	It is important that a patient is medically stable prior to being transferred to a psychiatric ward.
2. Treatment Setting:
1. Does the patient need to be admitted or could treatment be provided in the community?
This will depend on the patient’s need for medical management, their degree of risk, level of support in the community and their willingness to engage in treatment. 
2. If the patient is to be admitted should this be as a voluntary patient or under the Mental Health Act? 
•	Depends on the degree of risk and the patients level of cooperation with treatment. Use the least environment.
3. When a patient is admitted consideration will need to be given to the type of ward and the level of nursing care
•	If the patient requires close nursing supervision or is at risk of absconding then it would be appropriate that patient is managed in a closed ward, or observation or high dependency unit
•	For patients considered to be of high immediate risk of self-harm consideration should be given to 1:1 nursing care
•	There may be a lower threshold for 1:1 nursing care on a medical or surgical ward as the expertise of the nursing staff to provide psychiatric care will be low.
4. Psychiatric Management/ Modification of Risk Factors:
•	Reduce psychological distress or symptoms.
•	Increase social support
•	Offering alternatives to suicide (e.g. through problem solving techniques)
•	Treat underlying psychiatric illness or substance abuse/dependence.

Causes of Delirium in Elderly 
MISTE – a mnemonic for possible causes of delirium

M : Metabolic – hyponatraemia, hypoglycaemia, hypoxaemia

I : Infective – urinary tract infection, pneumonia

S : Structural – subarachnoid haemorrhage, urinary retention

T : Toxic – drugs (e.g. digoxin, lithium) or poisons, alcohol 

E : Environmental – being in hospital or the emergency department

Psychiatric Assessment of Aboriginal Patients - Principles
1. Build rapport: 
•	Be introduced to the patient by a familiar staff member
•	greet the patient with a loose handshake and brief eye contact
•	ensure adequate personal space, and give an explanation of who you are and of your role.
•	Ernest Hunter advocates staring the interview with a genogram. This helps to quickly establish family relationships, losses, and living arrangements and conveys interest in the patient as a person. It also places the patient in the position of expert.
•	Use non-threatening statements (such as commenting on events within a community or the person’s life) to put people at ease.
•	Create a problem list with the patient. This focuses the interview on the patient’s priorities. Use humour, especially at your own expense.
•	Keep language simple and clear. Make the patient a cup of tea, a gesture which symbolises hospitality, humility, freeness with time.
2. Communication
•	Informed listening: demonstrate an understanding about salient background matters that put the patient’s story in a context. Listen to both silences and what is said.
•	Use open-ended questions. Indigenous people may feel confronted by direct questioning and give any answer, whether correct or not, in order to deflect attention. It is more important to make a connection with the patient, so talk about things other than the mental health issue first, talk around topics, and accept that not all information may be gathered in one sitting, but that investment in the relationship is most important.
•	Talk slowly and wait patiently for a response (quick responses are seen as impolite), and be aware that anxiety about the interview may affect behaviour.
•	Particular cultural considerations include not referring to a dead person by name, taboos associated with the use of personal names, recognising that spiritual experiences are not necessarily psychotic, observing cultural norms (e.g. brief or intermittent eye contact, sit beside rather than opposite the patient), checking relationships and sense of belonging to country and family, awareness of the significance of spiritual issues and recognition of the effect of gender of the interviewer (if opposite to the patient, they may feel uncomfortable and unable to disclose information) and transference issues.
•	Obtain corroborative information from family, Aboriginal health workers and other involved clinicians and members of the community.
•	Concerns about confidentiality must be weighed up, but obtaining accurate information is important. Clarify which family members are significant and address confidentiality and consent to give information early in the process.
3. Mental state examination
Appearance, behaviour, rapport: Establishing the patient’s usual level of self care may help distinguish what is pathological (for example hygiene, the state of clothing) from normal grooming; recognising that scars may be the result of traditional rituals and not self-harm; appreciating that shyness is common and so avoidance of eye contact may not represent illness. 
Speech: Responses may be delayed, softly spoken and short. The clinician must also consider the patient’s familiarity with English. 
Mood: If mood is not volunteered, then offering suggestions with words commonly understood in the local community (e.g. “wild” for anger, “silly” for euphoric, “weak” for depressed and “strong” for good or well). 
Affect: Crying is uncommon as many Aboriginal children brought up traditionally are taught not to cry as it may cause sickness. Shyness and shame may also be mistaken for a flat or depressed affect. A patient may appear blank or expressionless with the clinician and yet be animated and reactive with relatives or familiar people. 
Thought form: Disturbances of thought form may be more difficult to detect if the patient is not fluent in English. Seek the opinion of relatives, Aboriginal health workers and liaison officers. 
Thought content: Interpreting the clinical significance of thought content requires awareness of accepted cultural beliefs. Check with the Aboriginal liaison officer or other clinician. For example, in some communities in far North Queensland black magic may be considered a cause of sickness or death and it may be accepted that the spirits of the deceased move around the living and are perceptible at times. 
Perceptual abnormalities: Fleeting visual hallucinations such as spirits may be reported in the context of intense emotional experiences. However, auditory hallucinations are more likely to indicate mental illness. 
Cognition: Be aware of biases which may adversely affect performance on Western psychological tests. Check knowledge of familiar material (e.g. sporting teams), observe behaviour in the community (assesses performance in everyday tasks), and check their cognitive reputation (talk to people close to the patient). 
Time: Aboriginal people often place events in a circular, rather than linear, pattern of time. Events are placed in time according to their relative importance for the individual, with more important events located as ‘closer in time’. Assess event/time orientation using culturally and personally relevant events such as ‘memory milestones’ (e.g. seasons, deaths, and family gatherings). Assess cortical function by having the patient name common objects, copy a drawing of 2 intersecting boomerangs, Luria hand sequences and primitive reflexes. 
Insight and judgement: Take into account cultural beliefs and norms, including traditional explanations of illness.

Childhood ADHD Assessment 
You are a psychiatry registrar working in CAMHS. Jack is a 10 year old boy who lives with his mother Lucy aged 32 and his father 37. He has a younger sister Mary who is 6 years of age. The GP has referred Jack to your service as he has been ' very difficult to handle'. His teachers are complaining that he is disruptive and his academic performance is deteriorating. 
Outline your approach to the assessment of Jack.
1. Gather information before the appointment : Parent and Teacher Strengths and difficulties questionnaire and Conner's Questionnaire to obtain information about behaviours and impact of behaviours. Clarify if there is any risk of harm to self or others as this may require more urgent intervention such as an admission for assesment 
2. Arrange appointment with family and Jack. The assessment will be carried out by seeing Jack on is own , then with parents and sister and interviewing parents on their own and together. 
3. Child observation in home and school. Interaction with parents and other school children. 
Assessment will be multimodal taking into account various sources of information across different settings. 
4. Observation of parent-parent and parent child interactions:Communication, boundaries, emotional atmosphere of family. 
5. Assessment for causes of behaviour
Onset duration and progress of behaviour and impairment across emotional, social and equational domains. 
Simple misbehaviour : Teachers may be able to differentiate and rating scales will help. 
Disruptive behaviour disorder: Traits of oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder. Persistent aggressive, antisocial and defiant behaviour. 
Disinhibited attachement disorder :distractible or restless, with attentional problems and social disinhibition in context of emotional and parental neglect
Generalised anxiety disorder : can present as disruptive but social disinhibition and impulsiveness is less likely. 
ADHD:
•	Inattention: careless with detail, is easily distracted, loses things
•	Hyperactivity / impulsivity  : fidgety, leaves seat when sitting for a long time, interrupts others, talks excessively in social context , ails to wait in queue.
•	Parents should be asked to complete a rating scale such as the Conners 3-P (Conners 2008), the CADDRA ADHD Checklist or SNAP-IV-C (Swanson 2007).
Autism spectrum disorders: Language difficulties, stereotypes and rituals and impaired social interaction. Difficult to differentiate and hence rating scales such as Autism diagnostic interview and Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale may be required. 
Juvenile Bipolar disorder: More likely if family history of bipolar , severe sleep disturbance .
6. Assessment of co-morbidity 
•	Dyscalculia
•	Dyslexia
•	Dyspraxia (developmental coordination disorder) and dysgraphia
•	Depression
•	Sleep disorders
•	Specific language impairment 
•	Tic or Tourette's syndrome 
•	Intellectual disability : specific phenotypes such as Fragile X syndrome
•	Assessment of cognitive functioning and patterns of behaviour is needed to identify other developmental disorders (such as intellectual disabilities, speech and language disability, global or specific learning disabilities, developmental co-ordination disorder, autism and related spectrum disorders, and Tourette syndrome).
7. Etiological risk factors in a developmental and history
•	features of ADHD in relatives (including parents)
•	mother’s alcohol, nicotine or illicit drug intake during pregnancy
•	Complication sin pregnancy or delivery
•	early birth or low birth weight
•	failure to regain birth weight in the first 2 weeks of life
•	adoption after 6 months of age
•	Temperamental characteristics
•	Illnesses
•	Developmental milestones. 
•	early exposure to environmental lead
•	early closed head injury with sustained loss of consciousness
•	persistent lack of sleep
•	dietary problems
•	ongoing family discord
8. Educational and social history : longitudinal academic performance, relationships with teachers and children. schools attended or changed, disciplinary problems. 
9. Physical examination: Involve a paediatrician 
Record and chart baseline height and weight. Cardiovascular examination.  Observe for co-ordination abnormalities and tics. 
10. Investigations may be required if Iron deficiency anaemia, thyroid dysfunction suspected. MRI is head injury suspected or focal neurological signs identified. 













	
Childhood ADHD Management
After the assessment you diagnose him with ADHD.
Outline the strategies for management.
1. A multimodal approach is recommended for treatment of ADHD. This may include medication, psychosocial management strategies and, where appropriate, educational interventions.

2. Psychoeducation to families
3. Behaviour modification
Behaviour modification (also known as contingency management) uses strategies such as structured reward systems, response costs and discipline techniques to encourage behaviour change. Rewards can include social rewards such as approval and praise, concrete rewards such as extra recreation time, or more complex reward schemes that involve “tokens” (stars or points) that can be earned. Discipline techniques can include verbal reprimands or time-out from positive reinforcement strategies. The time-out strategies involve removing the individual from a reinforcing situation for a set period of time following inappropriate behaviour.
4. CBT: CBT combines cognitive therapy, which aims to modify or eliminate unwanted thoughts or beliefs, and behavioural therapy, which aims to bring about changes in behaviour. The goal of CBT is to enhance functioning at home and at school.
5. Parental handling
Parenting classes: 
•	A child with ADHD requires more than standard parenting if he is to learn and prosper
•	It is particularly hard to be an effective parent of a child with ADHD, as the ADHD works against the child’s ability to learn and the parent’s sense of competence.
Recommendations: 
•	Set a small number of household rules, couched in language that is specific and understandable by all (‘Schoolbag always packed before going to bed’)
•	Get beyond simply trying to control disobedience, overexcitement or hyperactivity and set out to have opportunities for a good time with their child, showing him love and appreciation
•	keep verbal instructions short and clear
•	include positive comments, praise and encouragement, linked with a points incentive system where appropriate
•	consider deals (‘Get your homework done and OK’d by me, then you can go out’), but ensure that the child’s action precedes the reward or the parent’s half of the deal
•	use a simple disciplinary system such as ‘1-2-3 Magic’ (www.123magic.com)
•	avoid harsh punishment, harsh judgements and condemnations
•	keep the child’s social life alive, but arrange brief play dates with structured activities to avoid overexcited mayhem or fights
•	keep as calm as possible
•	plan ahead to avoid trouble.
6. Social skills training
Children with ADHD can experience difficulties in their social competence, peer relationships and family interactions. The aim of social skills training is to develop and reinforce the use of appropriate social skills. 
7. Parenting programs
Parenting programs (often called parent-training programs) aim to teach parents/caregivers strategies for managing disruptive behaviour in their child and improving parent–child relationships. Parenting programs make use of behaviour modification techniques such as structured reward systems and discipline techniques. 
6. Medication
Stimulants (methylphenidate or dexamfetamine) are the mainstay of medication in ADHD, particularly following the initial findings of the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) study. 
Methylphenidate is recommended by NICE as an initial agent (NICE 2008), although some individuals will respond better to dexamfetamine. 
A physical examination must be carried out before prescribing. Potential adverse effects on cardiovascular functioning (very mildly raised blood pressure and pulse rate) mean it is also necessary to check that there are no significant cardiac symptoms and no family history of sudden cardiac death in early adulthood. Monitor weight, growth, pulse, BP and sleep. 
Children who are anxious, have tics or preexisting sleep problems, or who need treatment that covers early mornings and evenings will probably need atomoxetine.
Clonidine and bupropion is also used but seek second opinion.

Causes of Poor School Performance
You work in a Child and Adolescent Outpatient Clinic and a paediatrician has sent you a referral. 10-year-old boy attends with his mother. He lives at home with parents and siblings. The paediatrician has diagnosed him with ADHD and Tourette’s and has prescribed him methylphenidate and clonidine with improvement of behaviours at home. His school performance has, however, deteriorated.
Question
What are some of the possible reasons for his poor school performance?
Here I will outline general causes. The question as you notice states that the behavioural disturbance is school specific therefore it is unlikely to be due to the medication or ADHD. Therefore weigh on other causes. 
1. Ongoing ADHD due to inadequate dosage to help with increased demands at school. Is the child at home in the evening when the medication wears off (Immediate release) whilst the side effects of medication lead to poor school performance. 
2. OCD symptoms, stand alone or medication induced exacerbated under school stress. 
3. Sensory impairment : Visual and Auditory impairment 
4. Epilepsy 
5. Organic issues such as Vitamin deficiencies , Vit D, B12 , Folate 
6. Learning difficulties: Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, dyscalculia, speech difficulties
7. Autism leading to poor social interaction at school 
8. Emotional issues: Chronic neglect, abuse, parental dysfunction, bullying at school. 
9. Poor sleep 
10. Onset of depression. 
11. Poor teaching i.e pedagogy , lack of support from teachers and school for special needs

Addressing Mother's Concerns about Medication
Mother reports she has read in a magazine article that stimulants cause growth retardation and “drug addicts”. The child has a diagnosis of Tourette's and ADHD. 
 Question: How do you respond to mother’s concern about medication?
1. Arrange a meeting and establish therapeutic alliance
2. Acknowledge concerns and advise that this is a common concern parents have. 
3. Psychoeducation about Tourette's and ADHD
4. Advise the mother that stimulants can lead to stunted growth but this is something that will monitored closely as will other side effects. Growth parameters will be assessed at baseline and monitored every 3-6 months. this will include monitoring of weight, height and growth velocity. 
5. If growth retardation does become an issue than medication can be prescribed at low doses only or medication holidays can be considered or medication can be switched to non-stimulants. 
6. Explain to the mother that there is no evidence that prescription of stimulants causes drug addiction. Untreated ADHD can be associated with a range of psychiatric issues later in life including drug misuse. Treatment of ADHD is associated with improved outcomes such as better school performance and social outcomes. 
" Overall, the results of the present study show that the long-term outcomes for participants with ADHD when left untreated were poor compared with non-ADHD controls, and that treatment of ADHD improved long-term outcomes, but usually not to the point of normalization. The outcomes that were studied (with ADHD symptoms deliberately excluded as an outcome) most often included drug use/addictive behavior, academic, and antisocial behavior. This was followed by social function, self-esteem, occupation, driving, services use, and obesity outcomes". Shaw, M., Hodgkins, P., Caci, H., Young, S., Kahle, J., Woods, A. G., & Arnold, L. E. (2012). A systematic review and analysis of long-term outcomes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: effects of treatment and non-treatment. BMC medicine, 10(1), 99.
7. Advise mother about paediatrician involvement and role of school. 

Tourette's Syndrome
You continue to prescribe him his medication and his school performance improves. However his mother is concerned about on-going tics. 
Question: Outline your management of his Tourette’s.
1. Educating the parents about Tourette's syndrome : Multiple Motor and One or More Vocal tics persistent for more than a year with onset before age of 18. 
2. Education of the school about Tourette's : Explain that stress can exacerbate tics and hence some restructuring of school environment and hence flexibility from teachers is required. 
3. General stress reduction and boredom reduction strategies 
4. Explain that stimulants can increase the risk of tics but prolonged administration can result in reduction , therefore consider a trial for 3 - 6 months. 
5. Paediatric and Neurological evaluation if the tics do not resolve after a fixed period: alternative causes of tics such as PANDAS, organic brain disorder, epilepsy , therefore MRI may be required.
6. Treat OCD with SSRI's if present as OCD and tourette's co-exist. 
7. Clonidine can be used if not already prescribed in mild to moderate tics. 0.1-0.3 mg. 
8. Haloperidol and Risperidone may be needed in case of non -response. 
9. Address self esteem, treat depression with CBT. 

Management of Patient Suicide on Inpatient Unit
You are the consultant of an inpatient psychiatric ward. Your patient is a 51-year-old man with psychotic depression. He appears to be improving with medication so his nursing observations are downgraded. When you arrive to work early Monday morning, you are informed that your patient has committed suicide over the weekend. He was found hanging in his bedroom on the ward.
Question: 
What is your immediate response to this situation? (This question has been covered previously so only the main points will be listed)
1. Clarify situation and ensure that adequate procedures were followed: Police informed, body isolated and documentation carried out. Has a IIMS (Incident information management system) report been filled out? 
2. Inform clinical director and Nurse Unit manager: Attempt to arrange a meeting with both 
3. Inform family and address their concerns. Allow them to ask questions , vent anger and hostility and provide support to the family in the form of counselling services etc. 
4. Notes to be copied and sent to coroner
5. Staff debriefing 
6. Patient debriefing with all leave for patients reviewed especially high risk patients. 
7. Seek support for self with supervisor
8. Inform medico-legal insurance
9. Root Cause analysis. 
10. Longer term consider case conference or grand round presentation as part of Quality improvement 

Breaking Bad News in Children
Your patient’s ex-wife calls you. She has been informed by the police of the death. She asks for advice on what to tell their 10-year-old son. He last saw his father 2 months ago. She is not sure whether to tell him about the suicide. 
Question 
Outline your response
1. Ethical Dilemma : Risk of psychological harm to child on informing vs withholding information. Therefore the information if conveyed needs to be conveyed in an appropriate setting and with appropriate psychological support. 
2. Clarify mother's concerns by arranging a meeting : What was child's relationship with father? Was it ambivalent? How often did father see him? Was he aware of father's illness? What does he know about father's illness? 
3. Guide the mother through options to help her make an informed decision with a risk benefit analysis of each option
4. Risk of not telling the child now may prevent immediate psychological distress but may affect the mother-child relationship in the future as it may raise issues of trust. 
5. Speak to a Child and Adolescent psychiatrist for advice. 
6. Arrange a meeting with mother and child with psychologist or other support staff who can provide after meeting support. 
7. Use General Principles of Breaking Bad news in Children 
SPIKES (Six step protocol for delivery of bad news)
Setting up the interview: privacy, involve significant others, make a connection, manage time constraints and interruptions)
Assess child's Perception : The child may know more than adults think they do. 
Obtain child's Invitation: How would you like to give you information? 
Giving Knowledge and information to the child by using appropriate language, avoiding jargon, checking understanding and using audio-visual aids f necessary
Address patients Emotions with empathic responses : advise that they are not to blame. 
Summarise. 
OR
When - decide on appropriate time to break bad news
Who - significant others
Where - private place , manage interruptions etc. 
What child knows already: Specialist support, truthful words " I'm afraid I'll have to tell you something very sad" Explain that death was not their fault. Explain slowly, pictures of necessary, repeat information and check understanding. 

Staff Responses after Patient Suicide
During the week you notice that the nursing staff are reluctant to downgrade nursing observations or to let inpatients go on leave. They request more nursing staff as they report they are unable to provide adequate nursing care. 
Question 
a. What are the possible reasons why the nursing staff are behaving like this?
What are the key strategies in managing this? 
a. 
Patient factors: 
•	High risk patients
•	Severely unwell
•	high rates of self harm and violence
Staff factors : 
•	Normal response to critical incident: change in behaviour to prevent future occurrences
•	Fear of being blamed or scapegoated
•	Lack of support or psychological debriefing 
•	Lack of leadership from consultant psychiatrist on the ward
•	Countertransference and transference issues: Fear of being wrong, tolerance for uncertainty etc. 
•	Uncertainty about the fear of procedure after suicide (not knowing if they have to attend an inquiry, what process to follow etc. )
System Factors : 
•	Culture of blame 
•	Poor staffing 
•	Poor ward environment with high risk structures that can increase risk of a repeat event. 
•	Absence of an adequate response from management to staff concerns
•	Poor training in risk assessment and management of agitated patients e.g tranquillisation policies. 
b. 
1. Enable professionals to recognise, understand, accept, and express emotions felt for the deceased patient (sorrow, guilt, anger, wrath, disappointment, compassion, relief etc.)
2. Enable professionals to recognise, understand, accept, and express emotions felt towards him/herself as the person involved in the treatment (disappointment, doubt, uncertainty, incompetence, fear, shame, anxiety etc.)
3. Enable the professionals to recognise how feelings about loss are handled(eg.denial or dissociation of feelings or, conversely, being flooded with overwhelming affect). 
4. Enable professionals to verbalise and reduce the fear of legal action or inquest on behalf of relatives, advocates, coroners and discuss ways of minimising this risk. Explain the procedures as uncertainty of the aftermath can create fear. 
5. Enable professionals to realise the limited control the therapist has over the patient’s behavior and life and develop a tolerance for ambiguity. 
6. Enable professionals to recognize the likelihood that, at least in the short term, the loss is likely to affect their work with subsequent patients as well as professional identity



























	
PTSD in a 49 year old Indigenous Female
You are the consultant of a community mental health clinic. Your patient is a 49 year old Indigenous woman who has been case managed and treated for symptoms of PTSD for the last 6 months following a sexual assault 2 months. On her way to her appointment today, she saw her assailant, who is a distant relative, on the bus and became very distressed. Her case manager has just approached you with concerns about the level of her distress and risk of self-harm.
Question 
Before assessing your patient, what information do you need from the case manager?
For this question please go through the principles on assessment in aboriginal population. 
The question consists broadly of awareness of a risk assessment, cultural factors and engagement issues. I will outline the main points only 
1. Risk assessment : previous risk of self harm and suicide attempts, acute suicidal ideation, access to weapons. You can add additional points from the HCR but only relevant ones
2. Cultural factors: Cultural elements required for the interview, language, explanatory models of illness, belief in traditional healing, is a indigenous liaison worker required? Please add the key issues in assessment in indigenous populations. 
3. Incident of trauma : Details if known to avoid re-traumatisation during the interview later. 
4. Clinical Factors: Symptoms of PTSD, Depression, Psychosis and Substance Use disorder. 
5. Engagement and therapeutic alliance: assess for stigma, attitudes to mental health services,  family attitudes to mental health services, compliance with medication 
6. Psychosocial factors: Social supports, confidentiality issues, psychological support received financial, relationship and accomodation status 






	
Indigenous Psychiatry 
You see your patient with her case manager. She reports after speaking to you she feels much better. She denies any self-harm ideation and does not want to be admitted to hospital. She would like to go home and would like something to “make me feel better and help me sleep tonight”. (This is from a previous exam and from candidates memory. The question feels a bit vague)
Question

What is your immediate management plan?
1. Recognise that symptoms of psychiatric illness may not be volunteered readily and therefore high index of suspicion is required. 
2. Clarify the complaint: 
Is there evidence of depression, anxiety or psychosis. Are there neurovegetative symptoms present. 
Are there nightmares leading to insomnia? Hypervigilance etc. 
Type of insomnia : early, middle or early morning awakening. 
Substances used
3. Psychoeducation to patient: Explain that sleep disturbance may signify another issues that may require antidepressant or anti anxiety treatment. PTSD may need treatment. Explain the risk of dependence with benzodiazepine and risk of weight gain and metabolic dysfunction with Quetiapine. 
3. Medication intervention: 
Small dose of benzodazepine such as clonazepam 0.5 mg note restricted supply can be given for few days OR Quetiapine 25 mg nocte. Ensure restricted supply. 
4. Offer psychological support taking into account cultural factors. 

Sexual Assault and Confidentiality - Indigenous Case
A week later the case manager approaches you and informs you that your patient is feeling much better after speaking about her symptoms. Your patient would like to disclose the sexual assault to her adult daughter. However she is concerned that her adult son, and other members of the community will find out.
Question: What is your response to the case manager?
1. Ethical Issues :
•	Autonomy: Patient has the right to make decisions
•	Confidentiality and Privacy - She wishes to protect the information from certain members of the community and family. 
•	Risk of harm on disclosure: Can the patient be harmed following disclosure due to ostracisation, community backlash etc. 
•	Justice: Wider issues about fair treatment of individual and a community as a whole 
•	Mandatory reporting obligations : Are there children involved? Is the perpetrator a potential risk to children? Is there an obligation to report to police or Child protection services? 
2. Discuss with the director or in peer review
3. Arrange meeting with patient with mental health case worker or such trusted health professional. Clarify concerns and situation. What does she think will happen? Explore legal options. Provide information about supports available if there is a risk of community backlash. 
4. The aim is to help the patient make an informed decision after carrying out a risk benefit analysis of all the options. 
5. Explore options and the individuals that can be involved: 
•	Community leaders / elders
•	Traditional healers
•	Indigenous mental health liaison worker
•	If patient agrees to disclose then arrange a meeting with daughter and patient with key mental health professionals including female staff. Ensure psychological and social support is available after meeting. 
•	Offer follow up meetings for daughter to ask questions , clarify situation etc. 

	
Trauma, Family and Perinatal aspects
Olivia is a 29-year-old married mother of three children, aged 12 months to 8 years.  She experienced significant sexual abuse in her childhood.  Olivia has just been discharged to the local community mental health team, at which you worked, following a three-month admission to a nearby acute psychiatric unit.  Prior to admission, Olivia became depressed after hearing that her brother had been found guilty of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter.  She developed flashbacks and nightmares of her own experiences of abuse and had frequent panic attacks.  She was found by her oldest child with a cord around her neck and admitted to hospital.  Her hospital admission was characterised by recurrent episodes of self-harm including lacerating of arms and tieing cords around her neck.  She was treated with sodium valproate, paroxetine and diazepam.  Olivia was eventually discharged on these medications and is still symptomatic.
 
Question 1:  Discuss the immediate and longer-term psychiatric interventions you would suggest for Olivia's previous sexual abuse.  Please give reasons for your choices.  (7 marks)
Answer:
1.	Focus of psychiatric interventions in the immediate phase.
•	It is important to state that in the immediate phase the focus is on risk management and symptom control.  It is inappropriate to do acute exploratory trauma-related work as this could result in an exacerbation of her complex trauma, depressive state and increase in self-harm behaviours.  This is also known as phase-oriented therapy in posttraumatic stress disorder, inappropriate to do acute exploratory trauma-related therapy in the context of acute unwellness due to worsening of the illness. (See PTSD review)
2. Psychoeducation and explanation of symptoms: 
•	Discussion of trauma, the neurobiology of trauma and how trauma worsens cognitive and emotional symptoms. Example:  Trauma can result in heightened emotional reactivity.  Trauma can result in thoughts of low self-esteem, self-doubt, low self-worth.
3. Cognitive behavioural therapy.
•	Simple cognitive behavioural techniques such as addressing anxiety, breathing techniques, relaxation strategies, addressing avoidance phenomenon, homework, thought substitution or challenging negative thoughts related to depression and behavioural activation to combat avoidance.
4. Psychoeducation by chain analysis.
•	To explain to the patient the link between cues to trauma (trauma reminders) and self-harm behaviours using techniques such as delay-distract to prevent self-harm, acting out on self-harm behaviours.
5. Longer-term interventions.
•	Based on phase-oriented therapy, when Olivia is in a stable mental state with respect to her depression and/or post-traumatic stress disorder, discussion with Olivia about trauma-based therapies for Olivia to make an informed decision with regard to engage in trauma therapy.  Olivia may or may not choose to work psychotherapeutically on trauma-related issues.
6. Evidence-based therapy for trauma.
Trauma-focused CBT. 
•	Prolonged exposure therapy and cognitive processing therapy are two types of trauma-focused CBT.  They are based on the principles of extinction, learning, habituation and desensitisation.  Prolonged exposure therapy, progressive exposure to the trauma narrative and trigger setting.  Cognitive processing therapy involves writing a trauma narrative and repeatedly reading it as a means to expose oneself to the trauma memory.  It also addresses shame, guilt and feelings of mistrust.
Narrative exposure therapy
•	a short-term approach that involves chronological cataloguing of their life and in-depth detailing of all traumatic events.
Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing
•	Therapy aimed to process distressing memories by having the patient recall distressing images while receiving one of several types of bilateral sensory input including side-to-side eye movements or bilateral tapping. Other types of therapies include supportive therapy, nondirective counselling, yoga, mindfulness training and interpersonal therapy.
Dialectical behavioural therapy.
•	Dialectical behavioural therapy consists of emotional regulation, enhancing distress tolerance, mindfulness and enhancing interpersonal effectiveness which may be helpful for Olivia to manage emotional regulation and reduce self-harm behaviours.
Question 2:  Discuss the interventions you would use to support Olivia's family.  Please give reasons for your choices. 
Answer: 
(When questions are asked with relation to specific family interventions, then it is best to consider the different individuals as part of the family.  In Olivia's case, we have seen that she is a married mother of three children, aged 12 months to 8 years.  We will, therefore, divide interventions for the different members.)
1.	Interventions with the husband:
•	Psychoeducation to Olivia's husband about complex trauma disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and self-harm behaviours to increase his understanding and ability to cope and support Olivia.
2. Safety of children.
•	Parenting capacity in relation to Olivia's ability to look after her children and specifically ability to look after her infant.  Risk of abuse, thoughts of self-harm and suicide, thoughts of harm to children. 
•	If risk of harm is identified, then Child Protection Services to be involved.
3. Interventions for the children.
•	Explanation to the children in an age and developmentally appropriate manner about Olivia's illness.  Use the SPIKES method if bad news has to be broken to children. (Covered in another MEQ)
4. Interventions for the infant.
•	Assessment of parenting capacity and assessment of attachment and bonding.  Parent-infant work when Olivia is well. 
•	Additional child supports as required for the younger child.  Mother-baby unit if respite is required or specific parent-infant work is needed.
5. Intervention for the eldest child.
•	Assessment of sequelae of the eldest child who witnessed Olivia's hanging attempt and treatment with regard to any sequelae such as posttraumatic stress disorder or depression.
6. Interventions for the extended family.
•	Addressing intergenerational trauma if present.  This may include parents, siblings and other family members.
7. Practical psychosocial interventions 
•	include involvement of social workers, child protection services, occupational therapists, Child and Adolescent Services and school psychologists, for financial assistance, home help, respite workers, adult supervision, childcare.
Question 3:  Olivia has found out that she is pregnant as a result of having sex with her husband when on weekend leave from the hospital.  She and her husband are concerned about the effects of psychotropic medication on the baby.  Outline the information and options you would discuss with Olivia and her husband.  Please provide adequate detail.
Answer:  This is a perinatal risk-benefit analysis.  The structure is as follows:
1.	Attitudes to pregnancy.
•	Discuss sensitively the attitudes to pregnancy with both Olivia and her partner.  Do Olivia and her husband wish to continue with the pregnancy?  If they wish to continue, then provide options for support.  If they wish to terminate, then the capacity to consent for termination may need exploring depending on her level of unwellness.
2. Risk-benefit analysis.
•	The aim is to provide information to Olivia and her husband in order to make an informed decision with regard to medication, continuing or stopping the medication.
•	Explanation of risks of continuing medication during pregnancy versus the risk of relapse on stopping medication.
•	Explanation that the maximum risk of malformations with exposure to medication is during the first trimester (first 12 weeks)
•	By the time pregnancy is identified, this is usually at eight weeks and the maximum risk for congenital malformation has passed.
•	Review current medications and cease any unnecessary medications.
3. Explanation of the risk of relapse of mental illness on foetus and mother.
•	Explanation that priority is to ensure stable maternal mental health during pregnancy.  Psychiatric disorders such as depression are associated with poor maternal and foetal outcome such as low birth weight baby, neglect, poor appetite, increased risk of self-harm and suicide for the mother and, postnatally, impaired attachment and bonding that can impact on the intellectual development of the child.
4. Explanation of risk of continuing medication in pregnancy.
Antidepressants:
•	Olivia is on paroxetine. Paroxetine - persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn with exposure in the third trimester.
•	Sertraline is considered safe as it has the least passage through the placental barrier.
•	Escitalopram is also considered safe.
•	Avoid tricyclic antidepressants. Be cautious about the risk of withdrawal syndrome in infant associated with the use of SSRI in the third trimester.
•	Consider postnatal monitoring for at least three days after delivery to detect any neonatal withdrawal syndrome. Fluoxetine has a long half-life and therefore can result in a protracted neonatal withdrawal syndrome.  Consider reduction of dose in later stages.
Benzodiazepines.
•	Olivia is on diazepam.  Benzodiazepines are associated with cleft palate with exposure in the first trimester, associated with floppy baby syndrome with the exposure in the third trimester. 
•	Neonatal withdrawal syndrome may be present when used in the third trimester.
Sodium valproate is associated with neural tube defects with exposure in the first trimester and neurodevelopmental delay with exposure in the second and third trimester.
•	Valproate is contraindicated in women of childbearing age and therefore an alternative may need to be considered even when Olivia is not pregnant. Lamotrigine is considered safe in pregnancy.  Lithium associated with risk of Ebstein's anomaly is 1:1000.
•	Lamotrigine is, however, evidence-based in the prophylaxis of depressive episodes and does not have antimanic properties. Lithium has anti-manic properties.
5. Breastfeeding.
•	All medications passed through the breast milk to some extent.  Sertraline as an antidepressant has least passage through the breast milk.
•	Consideration should be given to formula feeds, timing the feeds, expressing breast milk if medication that passes through the breast milk needs to be continued.
6. Specialist services.
•	Liaison with obstetrician, general practitioner, Perinatal Mental Health Service, explanation of specialised perinatal mental health services in the context of increased risk.

Migrant / Asylum Seeker Cultural Assessment and Management Principles
Question 4:  Emile, a refugee from Serbia came to Australia 20 years ago.  His parents and younger brother were killed eight years ago while seeking asylum before coming to Australia.  He witnessed multiple atrocities and trauma.  He lives with his wife and two teenage children at home.  His general practitioner referred him to you as he has been feeling teary with chronic headaches and sleep disturbances.  His general practitioner has investigated his headaches.  Outline your differentials.  
Answer:
[The important aspect here is to be relevant to the question.  One does not have to think in typical DSM-5 terms but to think in terms of what may be the relevant diagnostic formulation for Emile.  As each domain is written, the specific buzzwords that help you rule in or rule out the diagnosis should be written next to it.]
1.	Depressive disorder.
•	Emile may have experienced significant losses after his arrival to Australia in forced circumstances.  His chronic headaches and sleep disturbance may be manifestations of somatic symptoms and neurovegetative symptoms of depression.  He is also feeling teary.
•	Culturally appropriate expression of psychological distress as somatic symptoms
2. Chronic adjustment disorder.
•	Emile may have experienced significant adjustment issues such as loss of role, family and untreated grief that may result in a chronic adjustment disorder currently.
3. Chronic pain disorder, ie, headaches due to insomnia.
4. Posttraumatic stress disorder.
•	Insomnia may be due to nightmares. Hel has witnessed multiple atrocities and trauma acting as a risk factor for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder.
5. Organic conditions. (e.g Obstructive sleep apnoea, head injury untreated)
•	Organic evaluation to avoid diagnostic overshadowing, (attributing somatic symptoms to psychological/cultural factors only).
•	Relevant aspects include ruling out obstructive sleep apnoea resulting in sleep difficulties and headaches and an MRI for consequences of head injury.
6. Substance-use disorder. Substances may be used as part of coping with current stressors, alcohol, pain medication.
Outline your assessment process.  
Answer:  
[Here the question that should be asked is, what is different about this case?  We all know that one can write about a typical assessment formula; however, here one could ask, what is different that needs to be considered in interviewing a migrant or an asylum seeker or a refugee?]
1.	Awareness that the patient may be guarded and information may need to be obtained after establishing an adequate therapeutic alliance. Collateral information may be required. 
•	Collateral information may be important as part of the assessment.  There is a risk of disengagement, risk of mistrust and there may be associations of hospital or authority figures with trauma.
2. Awareness of cultural issues and cultural sensitivity.
•	Involvement of a mental health multicultural team with specialised expertise [in the assessment of refugees, migrants or asylum seekers.]
3. Involvement of a translator if language difficulties or patient wishes. (awareness of confidentiality issues as the patient may be living in a small community)
4. Risk assessment -
•	The patient may be guarded and therefore a high index of suspicion would be required in assessment with regard to the risk of harm to self or others.
5. Cultural assessment:
•	A cultural assessment would include specific aspects such as language, ethnicity, pre-migration role, employment, social status, reasons for migration, trauma during migration and post-migration losses: of family role, finances, etc. Acculturation and acculturative process
6. Evaluation of psychiatric disorders.
•	Psychiatric disorders may present atypically.  e.g:  Depression may present with predominant somatic symptoms.  A high index of suspicion for substance use as a coping mechanism.
7. Psychosocial evaluation.
•	Finances, relationships, vocation and accommodation stability. 
•	Current visa status of self and other family members that may act as additional stressors.
8. Medical evaluation to avoid diagnostic overshadowing: 
•	MRI, investigations of obstructive sleep apnoea, thyroid dysfunction that may be associated with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder, nightmares, avoidance phenomenon, hyperarousal symptoms, aggression.
 
Question 6:  What collateral information would you require? (4 marks)
Answer: 
1. Obtain info from wife, children, GP or previous notes
2. Evidence for risk. Risk of harm to self or others, risk of violence, aggression, risk of harm to family members.
3. Evidence for psychiatric disorders.
•	Hyperarousal at night, shouting in bed, thrashing in bed,
•	avoidance phenomenon of traumatic triggers, for example, not watching TV, listening to music, engagement with cultural groups
•	depression, tearfulness, social withdrawal, family withdrawal.
4. Evidence for substance use. Use of substances culturally appropriate, traditional medications, traditional doctors, belief systems,
5. Evidence for psychosocial adjustment issues, finances, relationships, vocation and accommodation.
 
 
Question 7:  During your assessment, you found no psychiatric diagnosis.  He states that his wife has been busy with her work and his two teenage sons that are not interested in cultural activity which he finds very frustrating.  Outline your management plan.
Answer:  [Again here, it is best to consider the family as a unit and divide the interventions for different family members.]
1.	Referral to a psychologist for Emil for supportive counselling, taking into account cultural considerations.
•	Although Emile does not have a psychiatric diagnosis, supportive counselling, problem-solving advice may help.
2. Providing information about local groups. e.g. Cultural resources, men's shed or local migrant groups.
3. Meeting with the family. Psychoeducation to the family about Emile’s difficulties, enhancing communication and bonding.
4. Involvement of an occupational therapist for vocational rehabilitation. This would empower Emile to take up activities or gainful employment, decreasing the feelings of isolation.
5. Psychoeducation to Emile about cultural differences and the importance of the children developing independence in a different culture and to facilitate the acculturation and acculturative process.
6. Other psychosocial interventions. Example:  Financial.
7. If relationship conflict present – relationship counselling




	
Behvioural Disturbance in Elderly - Dementia 
You have recently assessed Mr Newbury, aged 84 years who lives in a residential care centre for people with dementia.  Mr Newbury suffers from moderately severe Alzheimer's disease.  The staff are concerned that he is verbally aggressive towards staff and other residents and occasionally lashes out and hits staff.  Some of the untrained staff in the centre feel that Mr Newbury is deliberately playing up and are annoyed with him.  When you examine Mr Newbury, he is calm but severely cognitively impaired.  He has no apparent physical problems.  Recent routine lab investigations including midstream urine culture unremarkable.  Mr Newbury is on no medication.
 
Question:  Describe the information you would ask residential care staff to collect regarding Mr Newbury's difficult behaviour?
Answer:
1.	General behaviour and baseline functioning: 
•	Sleep, appetite, speech verbal or through gestures, daily routines, daily activity, engagements in daily routines and activity, number of staff, number of residents, male-to-female ratio, staff-to-patient ratio.
2. ABC analysis (antecedents, behaviours and consequences).
•	Antecedents: Triggers to aggressive behaviour, time of the day, sporadic or a pattern identified, e.g. towards a specific staff member or specific resident, response to diversion or commands.
•	Behaviours: Specific description of the behaviour, how long the episode lasts, other behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia such as disinhibition, confusion, self-harm, wandering, absconding.
•	Consequences: How do staff respond, is there punishment or positive or negative reinforcement used, consistency of the response, medications administered and effectiveness of interventions, environmental modification and psychological modification strategies used after behaviour.
3. Evaluation for Causes for behaviour
•	Medical causes: Example, fever, pain, constipation, urinary tract infection, delirium, electrolyte imbalance.
•	Environmental changes: Change in residence, change in staff, abusive behaviour from staff, abusive behaviour from other residents, changes in routines, changes in activity.
•	Psychological factors: New-onset illness such as comorbid depression, comorbid psychosis or comorbid disinhibition (mania).
Question:  When you return to the centre one week later, you find that staff have not collected any information for you.  Discuss the factors that make it difficult for care staff to collect such information.
Answer:  [When asked to review staff-related or systemic factors; a good approach is to divide this into staff factors, patient factors and system factors.
1.	Staff factors:
•	Lack of training about the management of behavioural disturbance of dementia
•	lack of knowledge
•	poor staffing resulting in an increased burden on staff making it difficult to collect information
•	Negative attitude towards dementia
•	nihilistic attitude that people with dementia do not get better
•	judgemental attitude towards patients
•	staff feeling scapegoated or blamed
•	information not explained clearly
•	language issues.
2. Patient factors:
•	The severity of the illness/dementia
•	severe behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia
•	significant aggression
•	language difficulties.
3. System factors:
•	Poor handover systems
•	lack of electronic records
•	inadequate staff
•	workload is heavy
•	poor documentation
•	shift work
•	continuity of care is poor.
 
 
 
Question:  The management of the centre asked for a teaching session for the regular staff on management of difficult behaviour and dementia patients.  Discuss how you would educate the staff.
Answer:  [Here there are two aspects.  They are the role of an educator and the role as a clinician.]
1.	Devising and delivering a talk: 
•	audience analysis
•	analysis of baseline knowledge of staff
•	a pre-educational survey asking what staff want to know
•	talk to be delivered in an interactive manner with opportunity to ask questions,
•	use case studies, practical information and provide other reading resources.
2. Content:
•	Nature of dementia
•	explaining that it is not the patient's fault
•	Common dementias: Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia. 
•	[Specific symptoms related to each], e.g
•	Alzheimer's dementia, memory complaints, difficulty dressing, forgetfulness;
•	vascular dementia, related to stroke, stepwise deterioration;
•	Lewy body dementia: visual hallucinations.
3. Causes of behavioural disturbances
•	medical causes
•	environmental causes
•	psychiatric causes.
4. Explanation about how to carry out a behavioural analysis, antecedent behaviours and consequences and ensuring there is a chart to document behavioural analysis.
5. Treatment of behavioural disturbance in dementia.
•	Environmental strategies: Adequate routine, regular exercise, music therapy, decluttering of the ward, adequate spaces.
•	Psychological strategies: Talking to patient in a calm manner, regular staff, consistent person, family involvement if necessary, the importance of positive reinforcement avoiding punishment, consistency of positive reinforcement.
•	Medication strategies: Medication to be used as a last resort, risk of using antipsychotics and risk of vascular events, to be used in severe agitation at small doses.
 
























Schizophrenia / Risk Assessment / High Expressed Emotion
Omar is a 23-year-old gentleman living at home with both his parents who are medical practitioners. He has been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder and has a history of cannabis and methamphetamine dependence. He has been treated under CTOs twice previously where he lives in another city and is on risperidone and lithium. He is now moved back with his parents under the condition that he takes his medication. Parents are prescribing and checking his levels.
Question: What information do you need before assessing Omar?
Answer: [The pattern that the college expects tends to be fairly similar.]
1. Risk: [As you can see, the patient is on risperidone and lithium so risk of medication is significant.]
•	Current lithium dose and level to rule out possibility of lithium toxicity,
•	sensorium if collateral can be obtained and the dose of risperidone administered.
•	Other risks include risk of harm to self and others in past and present and forensic history.
2. Identifying the treating team and clinician
•	Is he currently under the community mental health team as a voluntary patient or under a CTO (community treatment order)
•	Which jurisdiction has the CTO been implemented under. Which service has clinical and legal responsibility? 
3. Past history of illness
•	the severity of the illness
•	symptoms when ill
•	psychotic symptoms
•	affective symptoms
•	risk of harm to self or others.
•	Past history of compliance with medication and insight.
5. Current phase of illness
•	acute, partial remission or complete remission.
•	Current symptoms if identified - psychotic symptoms, affective symptoms.
6. Substance use history -
•	Current and past
•	duration of substance use
•	choice of substances
•	temporality between substance use and the onset of illness
•	intravenous use or oral
•	motivation to change.
7. Psychosocial history
•	Employment history
•	relationship with family
•	family dynamics
•	expressed emotion.
8. Medical history
•	Any contributing factors such as epilepsy, head injury, thyroid issues, metabolic dysfunction.
Question:  If his father calls the clinic and states that he does not wish Omar to be seen by the registrar even though Omar finds the registrar useful.  He wants the son to be reviewed by the consultant.  How would you outline your approach to the request?
Answer:  [There are several questions in the MEQ where the family member gets involved or there is some conflict between the family and the patient or the family wishes certain treatment to proceed in a certain way.]
1.	[Think patient first] Speak to Omar, explain the father's request and ask for consent to speak with father. Respecting confidentiality.
•	This is linked to ethical principle of autonomy. 
2. Ethical complications:
•	beneficence: acting in the best interest of Omar
•	nonmaleficence: doing no harm
[Educator and collaborator role]
3. Arrange meeting with the father: 
•	listen to father
•	understand the reasons for the request
•	acknowledge the concerns.
4. Psychoeducation for father
•	Inform the father that informed consent from Omar is important and breaching confidentiality may disrupt the therapeutic alliance. 
•	Provide psychoeducation about the community mental health team that the psychiatrist and registrar work together, that registrar is under the supervision of the consultant.
•	Inform that patient choice is an important part of management and consultant review is part of the management plan as part of the psychiatric review and therapeutic alliance is associated with good outcomes in psychiatric disorders. 
5. If the father requests a meeting with the consultant/director, then discuss with the consultant or arrange a meeting with the consultant for further clarification.
Question:  Father wants Omar to have more intervention and feels that not enough is being done for him.  He has read about IPSRT and wants to find out how this would be helpful for Omar.  Describe what it is and how it might benefit the patient?
 
Answer: 
[When psychological therapies have been asked in relation to a specific patient, it is important to not only describe the psychological therapy in generic format but then also to address it in relation to the patient.]
Description of Interpersonal social rhythm therapy (IPSRT):
•	IPSRT consists of interpersonal psychotherapy combined with social rhythm aspects. 
•	This is based on the principle that the interpersonal changes in a person's life along with circadian rhythm disturbances can act as a risk factor for the relapse of bipolar affective disorder. 
•	Interpersonal psychotherapy consists of addressing any of the following - role transitions, role disputes, interpersonal deficits or grief. 
•	Social rhythm therapy is related to the importance of maintaining a routine in individuals with bipolar affective disorder as disruptions of routine, e.g. sleep-wake cycle, mealtimes, etc, can disrupt circadian rhythms that can predispose an individual to relapse. 
Applicability to Omar: 
•	In Omar's case, the grief of having an illness, role transition, moving to parents' house indicate that he would benefit from interpersonal psychotherapy and the circadian rhythm disturbances, the importance that routine poor sleep would need to be addressed as part of relapse prevention in bipolar affective disorder.
Question:  Father has now prescribed and administered a depo, how would you handle the situation?
 
Answer:  [In this case, this can be addressed as a CanMEDS approach.  When we come across a difficult situation, think CanMEDS].
 Autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence
1.	Professional issues/ medico-legal issues: [Think patient first]
Examine the patient, rule out severe side effects such as parkinsonian side effects or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, check the dose of the medication,
Boundary violation:
•	Prescribing medication to family members is considered as acting outside the scope of practice.
Beneficence:
•	Prescription of a depo is a specialised treatment and requires the involvement of a specialist team.
Nonmaleficence:
•	Prescribing of depot unsupervised can result in significant harm.
2. Arrange a meeting with both father and mother [Collaborator & Educator]
•	Explanation about boundary violation
•	clear advice to the father to avoid any further prescribing 
•	advice to father to contact medico-legal insurance
•	informing the father that medico-legal obligations of mandatory reporting may need to be considered.
3. Seek advice by contacting medico-legal insurance about mandatory reporting.

Organic Presentation 
Question:  You are a consultation-liaison psychiatrist.  You are referred Bill by the Endocrinology Team.  Bill is a 45-year-old married electrician who has a history of pituitary carcinoma.  His tumour was successfully removed by the Endocrinology Team; however, since that time, Bill has developed mood lability, social withdrawal and low self-esteem.  He initially returns to work as an electrician; however, left his work after six months as he lost confidence.  He also suffers from chronic headaches and insomnia.  Bill has sleep apnoea and uses CPAP machine.  He is managed with thyroxine and corticosteroids.  
Outline the reasons for Bill's mood lability?  (6 marks)
 
 Answer:  It is important to look at the specific aspects related to Bill.
 
1. Endocrine related issues:
•	Removal of pituitary tumour may have resulted in a reduction in secretion of pituitary hormone; therefore, possibility of Addison's disease resulting in mood symptoms and inadequate supplementation with thyroxine and corticosteroids.
•	Over supplementation leading to Cushing's syndrome which can be associated with mood disorder.
2. Untreated sleep apnoea resulting in insomnia and chronic headaches.
3. Chronic headaches may be related to possibility of undetected metastases.
4. Depression secondary to corticosteroid medication, corticosteroid-induced mood lability and insomnia.
5. Cognitive impairment resulting in difficulty working and secondary depression due to thyroid dysfunction but also post-surgery inflammation.
6. Substance use as a coping mechanism.
7. Adjustment disorder related to surgery and loss of work presenting with mood symptoms.
8. Recurrence of tumour resulting in headaches and mood symptoms.
9. Exacerbation of an underlying mood disorder.
Question:  You meet with Bill and his wife.  Bill's wife has taken over cleaning, shopping and management of bills since Bill's surgery.  Bill feels angry and frustrated about this.  According to the occupational therapist, Bill is capable of doing these things himself.  
Outline the management of the situation.
 
Answer:  [One can think in terms of the CanMEDS model.  You can see three issues that are evident here]:
[The autonomy of the patient and the patient's wishes to engage in activity but also to consider the educator and collaborator role with both Bill and his wife].
1. Arrange a meeting with Bill and his wife:
•	Understand the reasons why Bill's wife has taken over cleaning, shopping and management of the bills as this may be related to anxiety from his wife wanting to help Bill
•	Understand shared goals, hobbies
•	psychoeducation to his wife that empowerment and independence will assist Bill in improving his self-esteem and may help in treating the depression.
2. If significant carer burden is identified, then involve a social worker to provide social support, carer support for wife.
3. Consider a neuropsychological assessment in relation to Bill's capability about doing tasks to obtain an objective measure.
4. Bill's decision-making capability with regard to medications, involvement in activities.
5. If any relationship conflict identified, then consider relationship counselling and consider carer groups or patient groups for wife.
 
Question:  The Endocrinology Team tell you that Bill's tumour has returned although it is treatable.  Bill has become increasingly irritable and labile in his mood.  
Outline the possible causes for Bill's mental state deterioration.  (4 marks)
Answer: 
[Although we would think about the pituitary carcinoma related issues, one also has to think about the adjustment issues that might be a play here.]
1. Pituitary carcinoma, endocrine disturbances: Cushing's, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism.
2. Frustration and depression related to adjustment and grief.
3. Fear of death, fear of cognitive decline, fear of surgery
4. Financial stressors: costs associated with surgery resulting in financial difficulty, fear of lack of support for the wife and carer burden.
5. Adjustment disorder or grief reaction in response to the diagnosis
 
	
Doctor and mental illness / Impaired doctor 
MEQ7:  A 35-year-old, Janine who works as a Career medical officer at the Emergency Department was referred to you by general practitioner for admission with five weeks' complaints of low mood, sleep problems and issues with concentration.  The general practitioner stated two past episodes of depression which were treated with antidepressants (eight to nine months each time).  He also noted that she recently had a complaint from the patient in the Emergency Department and had to take a week off.  
The director of ED called you to discuss her admission.  He tells you of the complaint made by a patient against the chief medical officer (CMO) of acting inappropriately.  
List and explain ethical and work issues.
Answer:
1.	Autonomy: Informing the patient depending on level of unwellness and preferably when stable,  of the complaint that has been made.  This is related to natural justice.
2.	Duty of care towards patient: If patient harm has been identified, then awareness of mandatory reporting obligations to the medical board, discuss with medico-legal insurance.  Follow local notification guidelines related to the service.
3.	Patient's confidentiality: One cannot discuss the patient's details with the director of ED without the patient's content.  This will be considered as a breach of confidentiality.
4.	Beneficence and non-maleficence: Acting in the best interest of the patient, taking into consideration risk of harm to reputation, be sensitive about the location of admission, preferably in a private hospital at a site distant from where the doctor works.
5.	Return to work with gradual support, involvement of the human resources and occupational health and safety via a support group, addressing any stressors that would act as barriers with return to work.
 




Delirium Psychogeriatrics
MEQ8:  You are called to carry out a home visit at Mrs Smith's house, who is 72 years of age.  She presents mildly confused, irritable and unsteady on her feet.  Her previous mini-mental state examination scored 21/30.  She showed impaired attention, concentration and short-term memory.  She is currently on atenolol, lithium, fluoxetine and L-DOPA.  Outline the possible causes for her presentation.
 
Answer: 
1. Delirium:
•	urinary tract infections, chest infections, common causes of delirium in the elderly as justification.
2. Hyponatraemia due to syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion due to prescription of fluoxetine and lithium.
3. Atenolol being a beta-blocker may be prescribed for atrial fibrillation.  Delirium may be due to pulmonary embolism or cardiovascular stroke events due to uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias.
4. Parkinsonism-related aspects: L-DOPA-related mood changes, excess dopamine resulting in confusion, irritability, unsteadiness on feet maybe due to inadequately treated parkinsonism.
5. Lithium toxicity, due to forgetfulness and accidental overdose.
6. Abrupt cessation of lithium resulting in rebound confusion.
7. Serotonin syndrome due to a combination of fluoxetine and lithium can result in confusion and unsteadiness.
8. Abrupt cessation of SSRIs can result in withdrawal, dizziness, unsteadiness in feet.
9. Possibility of Lewy body dementia which can present with fluctuating cognition, persistent vivid visual hallucinations in the context of Parkinsonism.
10. Other substance use, such as alcohol withdrawal or alcohol intoxication.
Question:  Mrs Smith is admitted to the Older Patients Mental Health Service Inpatient Unit.  What would be your advice to the registrar in prescribing of medications?
Answer:
1.	Start low and go slow.
2.	Optimise the medications and cease unnecessary medications.
3.	Liaise with the neurologist with regard to look at optimising Parkinsonian medication, liaising with the cardiologist to optimise cardiology medications.
4.	Carry out lithium levels to rule out lithium toxicity.
5.	Assess for compliance.
6.	Rule out medical causes for confusion and delirium, urinary tract infection, CRP levels for inflammation, hyponatraemia, urine osmolality and serum osmolality to rule out SIADH.
7.	Rule out serotonin syndrome due to myoclonus confusion, hyperreflexia.
8.	Liver function tests and renal function tests as medication dose may need to be adjusted if deranged.
9.	Extreme caution with regard to use of antipsychotics in the context of parkinsonism that can result in worsening of parkinsonian symptoms if Lewy body dementia is present, increased risk of mortality due to hypersensitivity with antipsychotics. Antipsychotics can also have anticholinergic effects worsening confusion.
10.	Benzodiazepines can increase the risk of falls and confusion.
11.	Caution about other drug-drug interaction such as prescription of ACE inhibitors and lithium, NSAIDs and lithium.
Question:  Her son is visiting from overseas and he wants her to make a Will.  
Outline your process of assessing testamentary capacity.
Answer
1.	Patient autonomy and capacity:
•	Is the patient currently well and stable? 
•	Inform patient of the request from son. 
•	Obtain the patient's wishes. 
•	If the patient is unwell, the assessment of testamentary capacity if deemed essential would need to be deferred.
2. Components of testamentary capacity:
•	 Understanding and retaining information.
•	 Decisional balance weighing up the pros and cons of making a decision.
•	 Communicating the decision.
•	 Freedom from undue influence.
•	 Consistency.
3. Specifics of testamentary capacity: The nature and effect of making a Will
•	The extent of her estate
•	who might be the reasonable beneficiaries of her assets
•	how she wishes to distribute her assets
•	the understanding of the impact of the distribution of assets
•	freedom from undue influence, freedom from delusions impacting on her decision making, freedom from cognitions that impact on her decision making, freedom from delirium that impact on her decision making.
•	consistency to re-evaluate after a period to ensure that the decision is consistent.
4. Record verbatim answers, check facts with solicitor, ask about previous Wills, why potential beneficiaries have been included or excluded during assessment.
 
Assessment of enduring Power of Attorney.
Answer: 
There are two types of powers of attorney, General Power of Attorney and Enduring Power of Attorney.  A General Power of Attorney is made so that someone can make financial decisions on behalf of a person when they were absent or if they simply prefer another person to make these decisions for them.
An Enduring Power of Attorney appoints someone to begin or continue to make decisions for a person when they no longer have the capacity to make their own decisions about the financial affairs.
Components of capacity (see previous)
In making a Power of Attorney, understanding and retaining the following information:
1.	Do they understand that they are appointing someone to make financial decisions on their behalf?
2.	Do they understand that they can appoint more than one attorney?
3.	Do they know that when they appoint the Enduring Power of Attorney, the EPA will begin making decisions or continue making decisions when the person lacks the capacity to make financial decisions?
4.	Does the person understand the effect of the document, that attorney can make decisions about the things detailed in the Power of Attorney document, these are legally binding decisions on their behalf?
5.	They can cancel the Power of Attorney or change it in the future as long as they have the capacity. 
6.	If the power is an Enduring Power of Attorney, the attorney will continue making decisions for them as long as they lack the capacity to do it for themselves. 
7.	If it is an Enduring Power of Attorney, they cannot revoke or change the appointment while they lack capacity.
8.	Freedom from undue influence: Can they communicate the above with assistance if necessary?

Child and Adolescent Psychiatry - Encopresis
Question:  You have been referred to see a 6-year-old boy, Sam, by the paediatrician for encopresis who lives with his mother who is a single mother.  The paediatrician has rule out any organic issues and started him on laxatives and a star chart which has not worked.  Outline your assessment of encopresis.
Answer:  
1.	Multimodal assessment
•	Assessment of the child.
•	Assessment of the parents.
•	Assessment of the child interaction with the parents
•	obtaining information from other sources such as a paediatrician, general practitioner, school observation, school psychologist, mother and any other family members involved
2. Liaise with the paediatrician to identify the organic conditions ruled out.
•	Ensure neurological conditions, Hirschsprung's disease, overflow incontinence ruled out.
3. Assessment of encopresis -
•	Onset, duration, progress, and aggravating factors/relieving factors.
•	Child is usually continent of faeces by 4 years of age. 
•	Antecedent, Behaviours and consequences: What happens before the encopresis, is it at the specific time of the day, specific location, is it pervasive across the setting, how many times during the day, any associated behaviours with the encopresis, aggression, agitation, anxiety.  Consequences - how does mother react, how does school react if it happens at school, any punishment, negative reinforcement or positive reinforcement?
 4. Assessment of comorbidities:
•	Pervasive developmental delay, social interactional deficits, stereotypical and ritualistic behaviour.
•	Learning difficulties: IQ testing, evidence of anxiety such as school refusal, separation anxiety, teariness, crying, sleep disorders, nightmares.
5. Developmental history:
•	Mother's pregnancy
•	complications during pregnancy
•	complications during delivery
•	exposure to substances or smoking during delivery
•	early childhood illnesses
•	infections
•	neurological conditions
•	delay in achieving milestones indicative of pervasive developmental delay.
•	 
6. Psychosocial history:
•	Relationship with mother and father
•	any domestic violence
•	any exposure to violence
•	risk of harm to the child
•	mother's maternal health
•	financial, relationship, vocational and accommodation instability contributing to stressors to the mother.
7. Reasons why star chart has not worked
•	Maternal factors:  lack of belief in star chat, inability to implement star chat consistently, inadequate training regarding the use of star chat administration of laxatives too frequently, noncompliance with use of laxatives or star chat. Mother not having enough time or support.
•	Child factors: Oppositional defiant behaviour, aggressive behaviour. 
Sam has not seen his father for some time, mother has depression and is on antidepressants.  His mother said that she is tired of bribing him to behave.  When he sees Sam, you notice that he has a bruise on his arm.  Outline your management plan.
Answer:
1.	Rule out severe injuries by involving an emergency department physician or a paediatrician for a full physical examination. The bruise may be indicative of a more severe injury.
2.	Involve a health professional with expertise in the assessment of child abuse, Child Protection Services, social worker, Mental Health Service and child and adolescent psychiatrist.
3.	Evaluation for suspicion of abuse.
Communication with the child:
•	Stay calm.
•	Communicate in a way that is age and developmentally appropriate.
•	Provide the child with a private and child-friendly environment.
•	Respond in a sensitive and caring manner.
•	Provide support without being judgemental.
•	Listen to what the child has to say first.
•	Use open-ended questions.
•	Avoid leading questions.
•	Do not probe for details.
•	Do not promise confidentiality.
•	Minimise the number of individuals examining the child.
Communication with the parent:
•	Adopt a nonjudgmental manner.
•	No leading questions.
•	Empathise but do not condone abusive behaviour.
•	Clear advice of doubt of what constitutes abusive behaviour and keep the parents informed if the child needs at all time clear documentation.
4. If risk of harm to the child has been identified, then consider the involvement of mandatory reporting obligations to Child Protective Services and their involvement, involve other legal guardians, social workers.
5. If no significant risk of harm to child has been identified, child can be discharged with the mother, then consider post-discharge followup from Child and Adolescence Services.

C-L Psychiatry - Complexity
A 4-year-old girl who lives with her father and her mother and has two older siblings, aged 8 and 10, was admitted to the medical ward for investigation of her abdominal mass which turned out to be malignant on histology.  Her father became irritable after being told the news, stopped sleeping and started responding to hallucinations and behaving bizarrely as per nursing staff.  Currently, he is by daughter's bedside, agitated, verbally aggressive to the staff, not letting blood samples be collected.  Nursing staff call you from the ward.
What information would you get from the treating team?
Answer:  [When you come across a conflict situation, again CanMEDS can be helpful]
1.	Who is the legal guardian? Is another parent involved?  What are the legal guardian's wishes?
2.	Is the child in danger from physical risk?
3.	Is the blood test urgent or can it be delayed?
4.	What de-escalation techniques have been considered? e.g meeting with father, explanation of daughters illness and prognosis
5.	Is the patient intending to harm self or others? Has security have been informed? Do police need to be involved?
List and explain the possible causes for the behaviour of the father.
Answer: 
The parent (patient) factors:
•	Acute stress reaction.
•	Exacerbation of underlying psychotic illness due to stressors.
•	Frustration and anger with treating team.
•	Substance use-related irritability and anger due to substances being used as coping mechanism.
Staff factors:
•	Poorly broken bad news.
•	Lack of time given to father to ask questions
•	Father has been unable to vent anger and hostility.
•	Lack of cultural sensitivity.
System factors:
•	Transference and countertransference issues related to the team.
•	Lack of continuity of care.
•	Regularly changing staff, resulting in inability to build a therapeutic alliance.
In this case, list and outline the ethical and medical issues.
Answer:  
1. Beneficence: Acting in the best interest of the child-  is carrying out a blood test in the best interest of the child; reasons for blood test.
2. Nonmaleficence: Could delaying the blood test result in harm to the child?
3. Autonomy and capacity: The child is unable to make a decision for self; therefore, proxy guardian required who is the legal guardian
•	If father is a legal guardian and is not acting in the best interest of the child,  consider obtaining consent from other guardian. 
•	If both legal guardians are not acting in best interest of the child, seek advice from the emergency guardianship. 
•	Seek advice from medico-legal insurance.
4. Risk and mandatory reporting: Since child is involved, duty of care to child and mandatory reporting obligation awareness if  risk of harm to child has been identified.
5. Duty of care to father: As father is ill, involvement of Mental Health Team to carry out assessment and treatment as required.
	
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome / Sleep / Adolescent Psychiatry 
You are a junior psychiatrist and Virginia is a 14-year-old girl who has been referred to your community mental health service by her family doctor who has diagnosed her as having chronic fatigue syndrome.  Virginia has a two-year history of excessive tiredness and nonspecific physical symptoms.  Virginia has had homeschooling for the past year, avoids social settings and has a little contact with peers.  She says she could do all these things "if they were open at night when I am awake".  She stays up watching television and talking to online internal chat rooms until 3 am and then sleeps until midday.  Virginia's mother, Mrs Bennett, has stopped work so she can care for her daughter.  The family doctor says he has excluded all significant organic causes of Virginia's fatigue but wonders if there are psychiatric problems.  He requests that you assess and treat her.  You take her history and carry out her mental state examination.
Outline the areas of history that you would focus on in assessing her presentation.  (15 marks)
Answer:
1.	Organic issues:
•	Blood test for anaemia
•	vitamin B12/folate deficiencies
•	vitamin D deficiency
•	thyroid dysfunction: especially hypothyroidism
•	dietary intake.
2. Assessment of sleep hygiene and routine:

•	regular routine or erratic sleep pattern.
3. Evaluation of fatigue:
•	Nature of its onset, duration and progress. 
•	Any specific pattern, all day or end of day. 
•	Any specific body aches and allodynia indicating the presence of fibromyalgia, fatigues worsening on exertion indicating chronic fatigue syndrome
•	aggravating and relieving factors.
4. Evaluation of comorbidities: 
•	Mood symptoms: presence of melancholic features, neurovegetative symptoms, example, loss of weight, loss of appetite,
•	presence of mixed features such as racing thoughts can be associated with sleep difficulties.
5. Evaluation of anxiety:
•	Generalised anxiety symptoms related to school or other stressors such as bullying
•	presence of specific phobias
•	presence of panic attacks
•	school anxiety disorders
•	presence of school refusal.
6. Developmental history:
•	Presence of attachment difficulty
•	separation anxiety as a child
•	child anxious temperament
•	anxious/ avoidant trait
•	evidence for abnormal illness behaviour in parents
•	conditioning phenomenon resulting in nurture or care through illness as a learned behaviour
•	history of parental physical illness
•	high expressed emotion [over-involvement, parental criticality or hostility and dependency.]
•	Presence of developmental delay or attention/concentration deficits indicative of ADHD resulting in school difficulties.
7. Psychosocial development: 
•	Peer group relationship
•	Academic performance.
Outline differential diagnosis you would consider?
1.	Poor sleep hygiene: Erratic sleep pattern, use of devices in bed, lack of routine during the day.
2.	Abnormal illness behaviour: Secondary gain for the child, obtaining nurture and care through physical illness.
3.	Secondary gain for mother through child's illness, codependent relationship.
4.	Organic illness not evaluated such as thyroid dysfunction, hormonal-related mood changes, anaemia and fibromyalgia.
5.	Underlying circadian rhythm disturbance, the parasomnias or circadian sleep rhythm disturbance disorder.
6.	Underlying mood disorder such as depression or mixed features prodromal type.
7.	Psychosocial stressors, bullying at school, learning difficulties, poor relationship with teachers or with parents, relationship conflicts between parents and chronic fatigue subsequent to a viral infection.
Mother asked for a sleeping tablet.  Outline your advice.
The general advice about sleep hygiene, sleep hygiene recommendations, maintaining a sleep diary, stimulus control and sleep restriction.
Psychoeducation :
•	about circadian rhythm disturbances and the importance of a sleep routine.
•	Sleeping tablet may be utilised for short-term purposes if other measures do not work as a last resort.
•	Psychoeducation that sleep medication such as benzodiazepine may have dependence potential.
CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) for insomnia with a referral to psychologist.
Sleep study, if the sleep hygiene does not assist.
Melatonin (Circadin 2 mg) can be utilised on a short-term basis one to thee months.
Finally, if does not improve, sleep specialist input, 
Input of diet and lifestyle changes.
 

Severe Depression and ECT
A 67-year-old lady with recurrent treatment-resistant depressive disorder, presents with severe depressive episode of two months' duration.  She has developed nihilistic delusions and is very agitated over the last two weeks.  She has been on escitalopram 20 mg per day for the last two years.  Husband and daughter are aware.  She is fearful of and has previously been adamant in her refusal of ECT.  Her brother died of suicide, aged 20, after having ECT for depression.  Her husband and daughter feel ECT is not appropriate and objects strongly to this treatment.  On the inpatient unit, she is initially commenced on venlafaxine, which was titrated to 225 mg mane over a period of three weeks with no effect.  Subsequently, she was crossed titrated with nortriptyline with a dose of 100 mg being maintained over two-week period as a mood stabiliser.
 
Outline the professional and ethical issues raised by this scenario.
Answer:
1.	Autonomy:
•	The patient may or may not be able to consent to ECT due to lack of capacity.  This may be related to the severity of illness; therefore, assessment of decision-making capacity, explore the patient wishes.
2. Privacy and confidentiality:
•	Respecting confidentially of the patient and obtaining consent to speak to family members.
3. Beneficence:
•	Acting in the best interest of the patient/ providing duty of care. 
•	The nature of the depression is melancholic and the patient has psychotic symptoms.  Psychotic and severe melancholic depression is associated with a high risk of suicide. ECT is an evidence-based treatment for treatment-resistant depression and has a high response rate in psychotic depression up to 95%.  Therefore, the medication may be in the best interest of the patient.
4. Nonmaleficence:
•	Withholding ECT may increase the risk of suicide and may cause harm to the patient. 
•	ECT can be associated with cognitive side effects that may be permanent in approximately 12% of cases with bitemporal administration.
5. Look at advanced directives and previous wishes if family refuses.
6. Second opinion, Mental Health Act legislation to be considered if fulfils criteria for significant risk and the patient lacks capacity.
Outline the factors that could be contributing to her depression failing to improve. 
Answer:
1.	The nature of the depression is of treatment-resistant depressive nature associated with nihilistic delusions and agitation, which indicates a psychotic depression
2.	Psychotic depression requires broad-spectrum antidepressants such as SNRIs or tricyclic antidepressants at higher doses (dopaminergic and noradrenergic antidepressants).  She is prescribed venlafaxine 225 mg mane, which is for three weeks, which indicates a subtherapeutic dose and a subtherapeutic duration. 
3.	Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant prescribed at 100 mg, which is of subtherapeutic dose [dose increased to 150mg nocte].
4.	The Mood stabiliser may not be an antipsychotic medication and antipsychotic medication is required for treatment of psychotic depression.
5.	Other factors may include severe vasculopathy as treatment-resistant depression and psychotic depression may be associated with vascular features.
6.	Organic factors such as hyponatraemia, thyroid dysfunction, Addison's disease or other organic issues such as a brain tumour considering the age would need to be ruled out or a lung malignancy would need to be ruled out.
7.	Other differential diagnoses such as neurocognitive impairment or prodromal dementia may contribute to treatment resistance and then non-compliance with medication.
 
1.	Psychological factors may act as barriers, however less likely considering the nature of the depression which has a higher biological weighting.
Question:  Outline the factors that maybe contributing to family's opposition to ECT.
Answer:  [Here again, one can think in terms of the patient factors, family factors and treatment factors.]
1.	Stigma against ECT due to media perception.
2.	Negative attitude to ECT due to negative past experiences, the suicide of brother after ECT.
3.	Lack of knowledge about modern techniques of ECT.
4.	Psychoeducation not provided about the benefits and risks about ECT in a detailed manner.
5.	Concerns about side effects of the ECT, permanent memory deficits, explanation not provided about different electrode placements and techniques to minimise cognitive deficits.
6.	Family may be respecting the patient's wishes.
7.	Poor engagement with treating team or treating psychiatrist, transference and countertransference issues.
8.	Cultural factors or beliefs in alternate models of care
After a lengthy discussion with the patient and her family, the plan is made to begin a course of right unilateral ECT while optimising the dose of nortriptyline to 150 mg daily.  By the sixth treatment, however, some signs of hypomania are evident.  Describe the management you will recommend.  Outline the possible treatment options at this point.  Note that these are options.  There is no one step that can be taken.  Your aim is to outline the various options that you can put in place.
Answer:
1.	Stop any further ECT, wait and watch.
2.	Space out the treatments of ECT and monitor closely for worsening of hypomania or morphing of hypomania into mania.
3.	Reduce the dose of nortriptyline to 50 mg with the aim of ceasing it, gradual cessation due to risk of anticholinergic rebound.
4.	Optimise mood stabiliser if present for treatment of mania.
5.	If antipsychotic mood stabiliser has been prescribed, increase the dose and optimise the dose of antipsychotic mood stabiliser in the context of mania.
6.	Lithium augmentation is an evidence-based strategy in both treatment-resistant depression and the treatment of hypomania.

	
Community Treatment Order and Schizophrenia 
You are a junior consultant psychiatrist working in the community adult mental health clinic, you are approached by a case manager, about Jarvis, a 28-year-old male, who’s case managed on a community treatment order following a first episode psychosis when he was 22. He works in the local radio station as a jockey and lives with his parents. He is prescribed paliperidone monthly depot over the past four years. His case manager tells you he is due for a review as his CTO expires in four weeks and needs to be extended. 
Question: 
1.1 What information would you need from the case manager to assist you before your first appointment with Jarvis? List and justify (11 marks). 
Answer: 
1. Risk assessment

•	Previous risk of harm to self and others. 
•	Current risk
•	Current risk of harm to self or others.
•	Dose and side effects from paliperidone needing urgent attention
2. Past history of mental illness:

•	Severity of illness to justification for the Community Treatment Order and depot medication.
•	Substance use history in the past.
•	Have alternatives for Community Treatment Order been considered 
•	Have other least restrictive options, such as community treatment team, assertive outreach team, case management approach, resulted in failure and non-engagement with services.
3. Nature of the illness
•	Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 
•	Last episode of unwellness.
•	Specific symptoms - delusions, hallucinations, aggression, negative symptoms
4. Specific points related to the Community Treatment Order: 
•	past compliance with medication
•	past engagement with services
•	history of refusal to accept treatment
•	relapse after non-compliance with medication followed by mental and physical deterioration resulting in hospital admission 
•	hospital re-initiation of medication resulting in improvement of symptoms of mental illness
5. Current mental state examination:

•	Presence of current psychotic features. 
•	Presence of current depressive and/or manic features. Presence of anxiety. 
•	Risk of substance use. 
•	Current active suicidal ideation, intent or plans. 
6. Current insight and capacity to consent for treatment:

•	Does the patient have the capacity to consent for treatment? 
•	Does the patient believe that the treatment is beneficial?
•	Does the patient consent to taking a depot medication?
•	Does the patient have expressed the choice for oral medication? 
7. Psychosocial supports:

•	Current relationship with parents. 
•	Vocational stability
•	Relationship stability
•	Accommodation
•	Finances. 
(These are factors that, if present, would be associated with a positive outcome with Community Treatment Order and depot medications.)
Question: What information from the review would impact on your decision? List and justify (10 marks). (Decision for CTO)
Answer: 
•	Previous risk of harm to self or others when unwell. 
•	Refusal to accept treatment and the patient lacks capacity to make the decision regarding his
treatment. 
•	The patient has a treatable mental disorder, such as psychosis/schizophrenia. 
•	The patient does not want to continue to take medication, which is likely to help improve symptoms and reduce the risk of relapse. 
•	Previous treatment in hospital has not been sufficiently effective to lead to remission or improvement 
•	Discharge from hospital has resulted in relapse. 
•	Patient understands the role of a Community Treatment Order and accepts the conditions of the Community Treatment Order. 
•	Community Treatment Order is the least restrictive option for the patient.
•	The patient does not currently need to be admitted to hospital ie. does not have active symptoms of mental illness that need to be treated in hospital and does not have current risk of harm to self or others that require immediate admission.
•	Patient lacks insight into his illness and has poor compliance with medication, both past and currently refuses medication.
•	The illness has significantly impacted on his psychosocial functioning, employment, relationships or accommodation.
•	Patient chooses a community treatment order
Question: A medical student on placement asks you what the evidence is for the use of Community Treatment Orders. Explain your response. List and elaborate (6 marks). 
Answer: 
A Community Treatment Order is a legal framework under which a patient can be stipulated to take medications, attend appointments to enhance compliance of medication to treat the mental illness and to prevent the risk of harm to self and others and to assist with recovery. 
Evidence for Community Treatment Order: 
•	It may be justified on ethical grounds as a Community Treatment Order may be in the best interests of the patient. (Beneficence)
•	It may be the least restrictive option for patients to avoid hospital admission.
•	Evidence suggests that they can improve under a Community Treatment Order, which reduces the risk of relapse and improve outcomes for patients.
•	Clinical studies have shown benefits. Patients themselves may choose a Community Treatment Order or families may prefer a Community Treatment Order.
Evidence against Community Treatment Order: 
•	Use of a Community Treatment Order may go against the recovery principles as it may be considered as a violation of human rights. 
•	A Community Treatment Order may undermine the autonomy of the patient, which is a key tenant of the recovery model. 
•	Community Treatment Orders can disrupt the therapeutic alliance, which is associated with good outcomes in mental illness. 
•	Despite a Community Treatment Order, patients may relapse. 
•	Community Treatment Order increases health service use and requires higher resource allocation.
•	Studies have shown negative and conflicting results as there are independent RCTs that have shown no benefits. 
Question: Jarvis, on meeting with you, asks what the long-term serious risks are with regards to being on paliperidone depot long-term. Explain your response to Jarvis. List and elaborate (4 marks). 
Answer: (For the exam write in shorter sentences; avoid repetition e.g paliperidone being a dopamine blocker..)
Extrapyramidal side-effects: 
Paliperidone is a dopamine blocker and longer-term use of a dopamine blocker can increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia ie. abnormal, involuntary movements, mainly orobuccal dyskinetic movements. This can be disfiguring and can affect self-esteem. 
Paliperidone long-term use can be associated with extrapyramidal side-effects, such as Parkinsonian side-effects, tremors, bradykinesia, akathisia and subjective restlessness that can impact on mood and sleep.
Prolactin: 
Paliperidone, being a strong dopamine blocker and passing through the blood/brain barrier can increase prolactin. Prolactin can result in galactorrhoea, gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, decreased libido and from a longer-term perspective can increase the risk of osteoporosis. 
Can reduce testosterone which is associated with depression, anxiety and poor cardiovascular health. 


	
Supervision principles and practical aspects of working with interpreters
You are a consultant psychiatrist working in the mental health service. Sarah, who is a stage 2 trainee, has been assigned to work with you. She contacts you with regards to arranging supervision and you set-up a time to meet with her. 
Question: What principles of supervision, as per RANZCP guidelines, would you use in this instance? 
Answer: 
•	Provide a collaborative goal-setting approach in a safe environment for issues to be raised, reflective practice and constructive learning. 
•	Regular, scheduled meetings of four hours per week over 40 weeks, at least one hour per week should include supervision direct one-to-one clinical work. 
•	Assist with the passing of the RANZCP exams. Assist with self-guided learning.
•	Monitor and observe trainee’s interaction with patients, peers and other medical staff.
•	Discuss the performance with the director of training, if required. Discuss adequate strategies for personalised feedback.
•	Strategies to overcome any weaknesses or challenges.
•	Ensure availability to participate in workplace-based assessments and completion of end of term training reports.
•	Feedback can be formative and summative. Summative feedback is often provided by RANZCP, subsequent to exams.
What are the principles of effective feedback? 
Answer: 
Feedback can be summative or formative
•	The goal of formative assessment is to monitor student learning to provide ongoing feedback to students to improve their learning.
•	The goal of summative assessment is to evaluate student learning at the end of a unit or rotation by comparing it against some standard or benchmark. (e.g WBA, Exams)
Feedback can be given both one-on-one or in a group setting. If feedback is meant to be one-on-one (individualised to the person), then provide a private setting. 
Flag with the trainee that the feedback is a formative feedback. Base feedback on behaviours that the supervisor has directly observed. 
Aim to develop a climate of trust. 
Feedback should never be personally humiliating or delivered in an angry, threatening or disrespectful manner. 
Provide an environment where the trainee can ask questions about how they can improve. Frank and direct feedback but respectful and constructive. 
Start with student strengths, followed by feedback. Finish on a positive note with an enhancing statement. (Sandwich method)
Give direction to the trainee and invite comments about one’s personal feedback. 
Sarah informs you that you have an upcoming assessment of Fatima, a 39-year- old Iranian refugee, who is the mother of two children, where she wants to use a workplace-based assessment for the stage 2 EPA (entrusted professional activity) on CALD - Working with Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Population. She tells you the meeting is scheduled with an interpreter. 
Question:
What are the principles of using an interpreter?
Answer: 
Three phases of interaction: pre-interaction information, the actual interview and post-interview discussion 
Pre-interaction information: 
•	Ensure that the interpreter is certified and registered. 
•	Obtain consent from the patient about involving an interpreter. 
•	Ensure appropriate language. 
•	Ensure confidentiality arrangements (that the interpreter isn’t from a small community that can result in a breach of her confidentiality). 
•	Pre-interaction information and briefing:
Meet with the interpreter to provide information on what one is trying to achieve with regards to the examination
•	Meet with the interpreter before the interview to explain the purpose or goal of the interview.
Interview:

•	Speak slowly and clearly.
Use simple, layman’s terms, where possible.
Speak to the patient, not to the interpreter
Clarify any confusing responses immediately.
Ask for verbatim translation if the translation is not clear. Avoid taking notes.
Concentrate on non-verbal behaviours of the patient. 
Post-interview discussion:

•	Meet with the interpreter afterwards for feedback. 
•	Interpreter's opinion on the normality of the conversation, speed of conversation and any aspects that would not be considered culturally appropriate or deviate from cultural norms
Sarah approaches you with an ECG of Fatima with concerns about the QTc reported as 450 ms. Fatima is prescribed an antipsychotic medication. What advice would you provide to Sarah? 
Answer: 
1. See the patient: Clinical state, pulse, temperature, blood pressure and clinical symptoms such as breathlessness or chest pain. If present, consider urgent repeat ECG and involvement of a cardiologist. 
2. Previous baseline ECG and QTc. Has there been an increase in the QTC ie. a QTc prolongation? An increase of > 60 msec from baseline is cause for concern
3. Rule out organic factors that can increase the QTc interval: 
•	Renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, electrolyte abnormalities, calcium, potassium, sodium, phosphate abnormalities and thyroid dysfunction. 
•	Advise that 450 ms is considered normal in women and the upper limit is 470 ms.
•	> 500 msec QTc interval increases the risk of Torsades de Pointes by 2-3 times. 
•	If QTc has been prolonged from previous baseline ECG, identify any additional medications that have been prescribed that could result in drug interactions, such as antidepressants (citalopram, escitalopram), anti-emetics, antibiotics or any medications that may increase the levels of antipsychotics such as CYP2D6, CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 inhibitors.
4. Options for treatment include if QTc is significantly prolonged and intervention required: 
•	Involve a cardiologist.
•	Reduce the dose of the antipsychotic and repeat an ECG.
•	Switch to an antipsychotic medication that has a reduced effect on QTc such as lurasidone, aripiprazole or brexpiprazole.
•	Continue with close monitoring
•	Correct any organic factors.
•	Address any other medications that might result in prolonged QTc.






	
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder 
You are a junior consultant psychiatrist in the community mental health clinic. You are referred by a GP for assessment, James, a 39-year-old unemployed electrician living with his parents. James has had a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder over the last 20 years. He hardly ever leaves the house these days and relies on his parents for shopping, cooking, etc. He has been treated with medications in the past but he has self-ceased all medications for fear of side-effects. He has been linked in with a clinic in the past but disengaged after a few months. 
Question: 
What do you think are some of the possible reasons for James not engaging with the clinic in the past? List and elaborate (10 marks). 
Answer: 
This can be divided into patient factors, treatment factors and illness factors
Patient factors:

•	Lack of belief in mental health treatments 
•	Stigma from the family
Negative attitudes to medications 
•	Alternate beliefs in treatments eg. traditional healing, herbal medications, complementary therapies 
•	Sick role, abnormal illness behaviour, dependent traits 
Illness factors:

•	Comorbid agoraphobia 
•	Severe anxiety
•	Social anxiety
•	Comorbid depression resulting in motivation, Nihilism
•	Hypochondriacal symptomology comorbid, resulting in fear of side-effects
•	Dependant traits
•	Abnormal illness behaviour
•	Schizo-obsessive diagnosis with auditory hallucinations or delusions or fear of harm from medications, team, parents.
•	Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder that prevent him from leaving the house, such as beliefs that parents could be hurt if he leaves the house.
Treatment factors:

•	Side-effects of medication. 
•	Cost of medication. 
•	Difficulty taking medication due to complexity of regime or cognitive deficits. 
•	Non-effectiveness of medication. The medication may not have been prescribed at the appropriate dose or for the appropriate duration. 
Clinic factors: (under treatment or separate)

•	Poor therapeutic relationship with treatment providers. 
•	Distance to travel to attend appointments
Following assessment, you diagnose him with obsessive-compulsive disorder without any other psychiatric or medical comorbidities or substance use disorders. James tells you that he is struggling with his OCD with compulsion/rituals, having to check and lock everything in the house. He says he is frightened to leave the house for fear that he might have left the stove or some appliances on and is fearful that his parents could be hurt. 
He agrees to engage in treatment with you as long as he is not admitted to hospital. You decide to provide psychological therapy (CBT). How would you go about planning and implementing CBT in James? 
Answer: 
The CBT techniques in obsessive-compulsive disorder that are evidence-based are Exposure- Response Prevention. 
The three phases of CBT include 
Stage One: 
Assessment, psychoeducation about the disorder and treatment planning: 
•	Developing a formulation about the anxiety disorder
•	providing psychoeducation about obsessive-compulsive disorder ie. obsessions and compulsions
•	the principle of habituation and extinction, the principles that maintain the anxiety
•	triggers, fears and rituals
•	address factors that facilitate or hinder therapy.
Stage Two: 
•	Reduce physical symptoms through relaxation, exercise, exposure to real-life situations in a hierarchical manner. 
•	Start with the least anxiety-provoking situation until the patient gains confidence and is able to prevent the compulsion. 
•	Exposure can be in vivo or imaginal exposure; 20 sessions, 60-75-minute sessions each. 
•	Encouraging patient to face fears; extinction of fear occurs to repeated exposure
Safety response inhibition:

•	Patient restricts anxiety-reducing behaviours e.g compulsions that maintain the anxiety cycle. Restriction of these behaviours decreases negative reinforcement.
•	Coping with anxiety without using anxiety-reducing behaviours enhances self- efficacy.
•	Relinquishing safety signals:
Patient relinquishes safety signals such as compulsions and patients learn adaptive self-efficacy. 
Cognitive processing:
•	Increasing self-confidence
•	Discuss what is learnt from the rituals and provide homework for practice outside the clinic setting.
Stage Three: 
•	Relapse prevention using the above techniques to maintain remission from the condition. 
What are the pharmacological recommendations for treatment of OCD in James?
Answer: 
1. First-line treatments are high-dose SSRIs. 
•	High doses of SSRIs are more effective than lower doses eg. citalopram 80 mg per day, escitalopram 40 mg per day; monitor QTc interval. 
•	SSRIs should be prescribed for at least 12 weeks to determine responsiveness. 
2. If there is no response, consider second-line treatments, which include clomipramine started at 25 mg per day with a target dose of 250 mg a day; recommended monitoring for anticholinergic side-effects. 
3. If non-response, other alternatives include augmentation with antipsychotics eg. aripiprazole 5-10 mg per day, olanzapine 5-10 mg per day. 
4. Lamotrigine, memantine, topiramate, NAC 2400-3000 mg per day. 
5. Other evidence includes 5-HT3 antagonists such as ondansetron 2-4 mg b.d, granisetron 1 mg b.d, nutraceuticals include Myo-inositol, 5-HT milk thistle. 
6. Treat comorbidities such as depression, psychosis, comorbid anxiety disorders.






	
Governance and Leadership
You are a junior consultant psychiatrist working in a regional area. There has been an electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) adverse event (critical incident) involving ECT for a patient. 
A First-year student asks you to explain what a root cause analysis is.
List/explain/describe (8 marks) 
Answer
A root cause analysis approach is an analysis used to identify the underlying causes of system failure.
Clinical risk managers and other healthcare professionals use root cause analysis to help find answers to questions posed by serious incidents.
It is an important part of clinical governance and aims to ensure that there is accountability and responsibility for the services that are provided and is underpinned by continuous quality improvement, thus any system deficiencies that are identified via the root cause analysis and implemented.
It is performed for high-risk, high-impact events.
 Identify the critical incident to be reviewed.
Arrange a committee that involves clinical risk personnel to evaluate it, which consists of a consumer, possibly a carer, team member directly or indirectly involved in the incident, consultant psychiatrist or clinical director.
Individuals that are chosen for the team are not individuals necessarily that have directly been involved with the incident. The principle is that the focus is on systems and processes, not the individual. This is done to avoid scapegoating
It takes into account a problem-solving methodology using analytical methods. The principles are TFEI:
•	Thoroughness
•	Fair
•	Efficient
•	Independent review
The steps include:
•	Verify the incident
•	Commission a Root Cause Analysis Team Map a timeline
•	Identify critical events
•	Analyse the cause and effect chart
•	Identify root causes 
•	Support root causes with the evidence
•	Find solutions
•	Provide recommendations
Teaching sessions to stage 2 trainees on the background, prescription and administration of ECT. Outline what you would do and how you would do it. (14 marks) 
Answer: (Note that this answer is overinclusive; please be mindful of time - you are not expected to write all details )
Electroconvulsive therapy is an evidence-based therapy for a number of psychiatric conditions. 
1. Indications: (RANZCP Guidelines) are: 
•	Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder

•	Major depressive disorder with psychotic features

•	Major depression;melancholic features (treatment-resistant) 
•	Major depression; peripartum onset
•	Bipolar disorder(resistant mania and depression)
•	Depressed patients who have not responded to adequate trials of medication and psychotherapy
•	Need for rapid clinical improvement
•	First-line treatment for severe depression where there is an inadequate oral intake, a high suicide risk
•	High level of patient distress
There is also some evidence of ECT in treatment-resistant schizophrenia
2. Background:
Efficacy and response rate
•	The response rate for unilateral ECT with melancholic and psychotic depression who have failed one or more medications trials are as high as 48%.
•	In psychotic depression, the remission rates may be up to 95% and those with non-psychotic depression, 83%.
•	ECT can also reduce the suicidal thoughts, actions or gestures in up to 70% after nine sessions.
3. Key considerations in ECT administration and prescription:
•	Dosing
•	Electrode placement
•	Pulsewidth
•	Session frequency
•	Concomitant medication
•	Anaesthetic approach
Pre-ECT assessment and informed consent: (You don't need to mention this in detail - a separate question can be asked hence the following points are covered))
•	Explanation of treatment
•	Methodology and process
•	Adverse events and side effects
•	Risk of transient anterograde and retrograde cognitive impairment
•	Irreversible retrograde memory loss particularly if bi-temporal techniques are utilised. 
•	The patient should be informed what to be expected before, during and after administration. 
•	Involve families and carers in the process by taking into account advance directives. 
•	Make aware that second opinions can be obtained. 
•	The patient should be reminded they can withdraw consent at any time during the course of the ECT. 
•	Clear documentation and notes. 
4. Dosing: 
Establish the seizure threshold (The seizure threshold at the lowest electrical dose that elicits seizure activity as seen on EEG or visible motor movement). 
The methods to establish seizure threshold: empirical dose titration, age-related or half-age method. 
5. Electrode placement:

•	Bitemporal 
•	Bifrontal
•	Right unilateral 
Pulse width:

•	ECT dosing up to 6x threshold for unilateral ECT while 1.5-2 x seizure threshold for bilateral ECT. 
Session frequency: 
•	The number of ECT treatments required by the patient is guided by the patient’s progress and clinical improvement. 
•	Courses of ECT consist of 6-12 treatments. Ultra-brief pulse method also present (0.25- 0.3 ms). 
6. Anaesthetic management: 
•	Pre-ECT evaluation by the anaesthetist.
•	Ensure the seizure threshold is not excessively elevated by drugs or dosage used. 
•	Commonly used agents are thiopentone and Propofol. 
•	Muscle relaxants, such as rocuronium or vecuronium to administer before suxamethonium to minimise suxamethonium-induced myalgia. 
Monitoring:
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) or Brief ECT Cognitive Screen and neuropsychological assessment if indicated. 
7. Post-ECT: 
•	EEG parameters of an adequate seizure (e.g adequate postictal suppression)
•	Evaluation in an ECT suite for any delirium, cognitive impairment. 
•	Techniques to reduce cognitive side effects include bilateral ECT ultra-brief pulse and Focal electrically administered seizure therapy (FEAST). 
Adult ADHD prescribing is higher than your peers in the region. How would you respond and manage? Your clinical director hands you an evaluation showing that your practice was prescribing psychostimulants vastly different to those of your peers. How would you go about addressing this? 
Answer: 
This question points to quality improvement or an audit of one’s own practice. 
Steps in the audit:
1. Identifying the process to be reviewed, which is ADHD prescribing compared to peers. 
2. Establishing a gold-standard. 
•	Literature review
•	speaking to colleagues
•	peer review groups
•	Identifying psychostimulant prescription related to patient presentations.
3. Identifying the discrepancy.
4. Identifying the causes for the discrepancy.
•	Patient factors
•	Clinical factors
•	System factors
Patient factors:
•	Higher presentation of ADHD.
•	A greater number of patients with substance abuse presentations, which is linked to ADHD presentations.
•	Better access for patients that assists in an early pickup of ADHD.
•	Other patient factors may include greater awareness in the community about ADHD.
•	Good mental health literacy about ADHD in community
Clinical factors:
•	Other psychiatrists or other colleagues may be hesitant in prescribing psychostimulants
•	Lack of training or inadequate training about the diagnosis of ADHD or prescribing psychostimulants. 
•	A negative attitude towards prescribing psychostimulants or diagnosis of ADHD. 
System factors:
•	Lack of private psychiatrists or psychiatrists to prescribed psychostimulants in the community to treat ADHD
•	The possibility that word-of-mouth with patients presenting with ADHD to the clinician.
Self factors:
•	The possibility that prescribing may be inadequate, therefore, seek peer review supervision and an independent review
5. Implement solutions to manage the discrepancy. 
•	Independent peer review
•	Seeking advice about appropriate training in ADHD and prescribing of stimulants
•	Attending conferences, upskilling, CPD.
•	Grand round discussion or the consultant peer review group to obtain an open and transparent understanding of prescribing practices with regards to psychostimulants and reasons for this.
•	A qualitative analysis. Answering why prescribing is greater rather than the statistics.
•	Seeking advice from medico-legal insurance and ensuring good documentation, diagnosis of ADHD, obtaining collateral information when making the diagnosis and prescribing according to the States and Territories Guidelines.
6. Re-Audit in 6 mths-1 year




Clozapine and Antipsychotic Switching
A 45-year-old gentleman with schizophrenia working as a gardener recently relocated from another service. You have access to his previous information. 
He is able to make decisions for himself. He is stable on paroxetine 400mg daily for the last 15 years. The new case manager tells you the hand over from previous community mental health team has been adequate and all relevant documents have been sent across. 
Joe wants to change his anti-psychotic because he is struggling with side effects of tiredness, sleeping 12 hours a day, his head feels foggy and he can only work two days a week (as a gardener) due to these symptoms. He is compliant with medications but on the odd occasion that he forgets his clozapine, he feels brighter. What information would you like to find out before you consider Joe’s request for medication change? 
1. Current clozapine level: (350-600 ng/ml)
•	Clozapine levels may be elevated due to a range of interactions.
•	Identify smoking habits
•	caffeine habits
•	Additional medication that may increase the levels of clozapine or recent infections resulting in antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin or erythromycin, which are CYP1A2 inhibitors.
•	Smoking recently being stopped, resulting in an increase in clozapine, or the use of antidepressants, such as fluvoxamine.
2. Past psychiatric history
•	Past history of mental illness
•	nature of illness
•	severity of illness
•	risks when unwell
•	risk of harm to self and others
•	compliance with medication
•	Previous side effects from clozapine and how they were managed
•	Is this new or has he previously complained of sedation?
3. Past insight and compliance with medication
4. Reasons for sedation and tiredness
Organic factors, such as hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnoea.
Other medication resulting in over-sedation, such as quetiapine combination, and substance-induced (benzodiazepine; alcohol use).
Use of sleep medication in conjunction with clozapine.
Extrapyramidal side effects from the use of clozapine
Alternate antipsychotic prescribed in conjunction with clozapine resulting in blunting tiredness, and fatigue.
Current Mental state Exam: 
•	Presence of delusions or hallucinations resulting in sleep difficulties or agitation
•	Presence of depression resulting in tiredness and fatigue, memory issues
•	Use of cannabis resulting in an amotivational-type syndrome
You decide to go ahead and change Joe’s antipsychotic, what strategies can you use to safely transition him from clozapine to another antipsychotic? 
Risk/benefit analysis 
•	Clozapine has strong antihistaminergic and strong anticholinergic properties. Therefore, sudden cessation of clozapine can result in antihistaminergic and anticholinergic rebound that can present with severe rebound insomnia, severe rebound affective symptoms and severe rebound psychosis. In addition, anticholinergic delirium is also a possibility. 
•	Therefore, the transition to an alternate antipsychotic should take these into consideration
•	From an evidence-based perspective, clozapine is evidence-based in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. 
•	Evidence suggests that olanzapine may be appropriate, but newer antipsychotics that are metabolically friendly may be considered, such as lurasidone, brexpiprazole or aripiprazole.
•	Abrupt cessation of clozapine carries a high risk of rebound psychosis and rebound anticholinergic symptoms. If rebound psychosis occurs, it can be severe and accompanied by physical and autonomic symptoms that resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome. 
•	If possible, clozapine should be stopped very slowly over 6 weeks. Very high-risk patients should stop clozapine over 3–6 months.
•	If the patient is changed from clozapine to olanzapine, olanzapine also has antihistaminergic and anticholinergic properties and transition can reduce antihistaminergic or anticholinergic rebound.
•	If clozapine is changed to brexpiprazole, lurasidone or aripiprazole, these antipsychotics lack the significant anticholinergic and antihistaminergic property and pose a risk of relapse, therefore, clozapine should be reduced to a low dose whilst the patient is stabilised on an adequate dose of lurasidone or a non-antihistaminergic/antipsychotic and clozapine should be stopped after an extended period of time to a gradual reduction to prevent antihistaminergic/anticholinergic rebound.
•	To prevent the risk of relapse, an inpatient admission may be appropriate
•	If inpatient admission cannot be implemented, an assertive outreach approach or regular post-follow up appointments of case manager would be appropriate.
•	Alternatively, psychoeducation can be provided about risks and benefits, and early relapse signs.
•	The involvement of family to detect early relapse signs. The principle is that the transition should be done extremely gradually, which may be over a period of six months to even over a year.
A medical student asks you to explain what the withdrawal and discontinuation syndromes one might experience from stopping an antipsychotic. How would you answer this question? (4 marks)
•	The withdrawal symptoms and discontinuation symptoms with antipsychotics are mainly due to dopaminergic, antihistaminergic and anticholinergic rebound. For antipsychotic medication such as olanzapine, clozapine and quetiapine which have strong anticholinergic and antihistaminic antagonism, discontinuation may result in rebound insomnia, affective symptoms and psychotic symptoms and a relapse of the illness.
•	Reduction, therefore, should be done in a graded manner.
•	Refer to a switching tool.  NPS switching Tool. 
•	If changing to an antipsychotic with an antihistaminergic property, then a direct cross-titration can be considered as this reduces the risk of antihistaminergic and anticholinergic rebound. Close monitoring should be in place when considering changeover. The appropriate choices of antipsychotic should be considered when transitioned. 
Withdrawal and discontinuation syndromes: 
1. Cholinergic syndrome
•	Nausea, vomiting, headache
•	restlessness, anxiety, insomnia
•	fatigue, malaise, myalgia, diaphoresis, rhinitis, paraesthesia, loose bowels
2. Dopaminergic syndrome
Withdrawal dyskinesia, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia
3. Rebound psychosis (Dopaminergic)
Psychosis above pre-treatment levels, delusions, hallucinations, catatonia

Management of Acute Aggression 
Question 1: [Please note these are questions from memory. So there may be some ambiguity. We are working to cover the main principles. The answers have focused on broad domains. Ensure you add specific aspects in those domains depending on the number of marks.]
You are an on-call psychiatrist in a large hospital. Your registrar calls to get advice on a case. A male has been brought into ED after his wife called the police reporting she and her child are unsafe from him. He is not known to mental health services. He is well known to police who have had contact with him on multiple occasions and he has a history of amphetamine possession. [Aggressive man brought in by police on Amphetamine after his wife and kids felt threatened and contacted police]. He received 10mg IV Droperidol twice and IM Midazolam for sedation and needed physical restraint. He is unresponsive after that. 
5.1 List immediate management (4 marks)
1. CPR and medical emergency call for resuscitation if the patient is unresponsive. 
2. Monitoring of vital signs and level of sedation 
•	IM midazolam can be associated with unpredicted oversedation, oxygen desaturation, airway obstruction requiring intervention 
•	Droperidol adverse effects include hypotension, respiratory depression (especially if administered with benzodiazepines), extrapyramidal side effects (laryngeal dystonia) and QT prolongation leading to torsades de pointes. 
3. Setting of treatment: Sedation of the patient should occur in an area where resuscitation equipment and appropriate monitoring is immediately available and wherever possible should be undertaken in a resuscitation room
4. Collateral from family: Risk assessment - safety of the child and safety of wife. Illness history
5. Safety when the patient is awake - inform security. 1-1 nurse special. Separate room. IV line intact with monitoring of vitals if further tranquillisation is required. Close monitoring with psychiatric input to differentiate between aggression due to illness and differentiating delirium. 
If the question is on managing acute aggression in the context of psychosis/methamphetamine intoxication or use, then please see this step-wise protocol for management. 
Question 2: 
The nurse says he is awake and physically stable and requests a psychiatric assessment
What will you ask the registrar to check? (6 marks)
1. Safety and suitability for assessment - 
•	Safe space
•	1-1 nursing
•	Separate room
•	Security informed
•	Duress alarm 
•	Assessment with colleague 
2. Risk assessment: 
Absconding, self-harm, harm to others, access to objects that can be used as weapons. 
Safety of child and wife - Is child protection involved? 
3. Assessment for medical causes of behavioural disturbances
•	General medical condition: acute delirium, head trauma, encephalitis, meningitis
•	Infection, infected needle marks , encephalopathy (particularly from liver or renal failure), metabolic derangement (e.g. hyponatraemia, hypocalcaemia, hypoglycemia), hypoxia, seizure (post-ictal) 
4. Psychiatric assessment / Mental state examination 
•	Psychosis - agitation, responding to unseen stimuli, delusions
•	Depression - depressed affect / suicidal ideation , guilt, worthlessness
•	Mania - pressure of speech and flight of ideas, gradiose ideation 
5. Assessment for Intoxication/withdrawal: 
Amphetamines: tachycardia, sweating, tics, hallucinosis
Alcohol, hallucinogens, cannabis, synthetics, opioids, benzodiazepines 
6. Psychosocial assessment - 
AVO or intervention orders present due to violence 
Question 3: Registrar asks you what the principles of management of safe practices in Acute severe behavioural Disturbances? (12 marks) -[main principles have been stated - please add info as needed in exam.much of it has been covered in other questions previously 
1.	Safety
2.	Medical and psychiatric evaluation - as in question 2
3.	Deescalation techniques: 
Approach in a calm, confident and non-threatening manner, with a non-aggressive stance with arms relaxed.
Be empathic, non-judgemental and respectful. Listen to the patient’s concerns.
Use a slow, clear and steady voice and don’t raise your voice. If the patient raises their voice, pause and wait for an opening and allow the patient to vent some of their frustrations.
Getting trusted relatives or staff to talk to the patient may help. If the patient persists in directing their anger or suspicion directly at the clinician, it may be appropriate for you to ask another staff member to attempt de-escalation.
4.	Legal aspects – Guardianship / MHA / Restraint and seclusion
5.	Management of acute behavioural disturbance - The aim is to achieve an appropriate and safe level of sedation quickly with sufficient medication to manage acute behavioural disturbance and to facilitate an accurate assessment and appropriate management of the patient’s underlying condition. The level of sedation should ensure that the patient is drowsy but rousable. The procedure is not intended to render the patient unconscious.
6.	Monitoring - setting 
7.	Debriefing: The experience of sedation and/or restraint can be a distressing experience for the patient. A skilled staff member who is able to listen to the patient’s experience as well as provide feedback and rationale for the intervention should be considered in the patient mental health care plan at a later stage. Consideration should also be given to the emotional wellbeing of other patients and/or visitors who witness such events.

Psychotherapy 
Question 1
Young IT clinician, not socialising, spends most of the time on the computer late at night, well-functioning but thinks that “I am a loner, I am a loser”. His father died 3 years back, he enjoyed wood cutting with him and misses him. Isolating in past 3 years has gained weight.
You have diagnosed him with mild to moderate depression and he wants to do psychotherapy.
List and debate the MOST important psychotherapy options for him. (12 marks)
In this answer, it is important to follow a pattern
Psychotherapy modality / Principles or reasons for benefits or  Evidence in depression / Linking psychotherapy modality to the patient clinical picture. Not all of these modalities need to be mentioned . CBT has been discussed - please do this with other therapies that you choose. 
Cognitive behavioural therapy - Evidence-based treatment in mild to moderate depression. Depression is linked to negative dysfunctional assumptions of self - e.g low self-esteem, low self-worth, self-doubt. These affect emotions leading to low mood, feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness which in turn affect behaviour e.g avoidance behaviour. CBT addresses these core domains e.g Cognitive strategies include - thought substitution, challenging, reframing. Behavioural strategies to combat avoidance - behavioural activation. In this case, CBT could address negative cognitions e.g I'm a loser, I'm a loner " Behavioural activation - reinstating wood cutting - exercise could also lead to weight loss improving self-esteem and may combat social isolation. 
Interpersonal psychotherapy - Role transitions, interpersonal deficits, role disputes and grief.
Schema therapy- similar to CBT - core scheme addressed 
ACT
Social skills
Grief therapy
Behavioural activation
Non-directive supportive therapy
Problem-solving therapy
He prefers face to face CBT
•	List and explain what will you cover in homework with him. (9 marks)
Behavioural Activation: 
Getting active, depressed patients out of bed or off the couch, and helping them resume normal activity
Monitoring automatic thoughts:  
Encourage your patients to ask themselves, “What’s going through my mind right now?” thought diary 
Evaluating and responding to automatic thoughts
Help patients modify their inaccurate and dysfunctional thoughts and write down their new way of thinking. Patients will also learn to evaluate their own thinking and practice doing so between sessions. Thought diary 
Problem-solving
Help patients devise solutions to their problems, which they will implement between sessions.
Behavioural skills
To effectively solve their problems, patients may need to learn new skills, which they will practice for homework.
Behavioural experiments
Patients may need to directly test the validity of automatic thoughts that seem distorted, such as “I’ll feel better if I stay in bed”. 
Bibliotherapy
Providing reading material. Important concepts you are discussing in session can be greatly reinforced when patients read about them in black and white.
Preparing for the next session
The beginning part of each therapy session can be greatly sped up if patients think about what is important to tell you before entering your office.
He reported to the registrar that you are supervising that he does not want to do homework.
List and explain factors preventing him from doing homework. (7 marks) - Similar questions have been covered previously so please refer to those. 
•	Patient factors

Perinatal Psychiatry and IVF
39 years old, single lady, on DSP, diagnosed with chronic Schizoaffective disorder, maintained on Clozapine 600mg and lithium, no substance use disorder, good compliance and engaging well with the last admission 3 years back. Her BMI is 35.
Does she want to have a baby via IVF? 
2.1 What advice you will give her. (9 marks) 
Key domains: please fill in necessary material relevant to each domain. focus on key issues. 
Here the assumption is she is well. But if the question doesn't allude to that - current mental state exam and capacity to make decisions is a separate domain. 
1. Sensitive discussion about desire to have baby. 
Non-judgmental attitude, reasons to have a baby (personal goals), her understanding of risks of having baby and risk of illness and medication. Current partner. Is she sexually active? Is she on contraception? 
Positive validation that she is planning in advance - shows good insight. 
2. Risk-benefit analysis - similar to all perinatal psychiatry questions 
Risk of medications on pregnancy/risk of illness relapse 
3. Specific risk of IVF - as IVF includes hormonal treatments and can be a stressful period - the risk of relapse is to be monitored. close monitoring with IVF specialist. IVF specialists may require a report or letter regarding capacity and mental state to proceed with IVF. 
4. Risk of illness relapse and impact on pregnancy and fetus 
6. Risk of clozapine during pregnancy and monitoring levels 
7. Risk of lithium during pregnancy and monitoring levels 
8. Risk of clozapine during breastfeeding and monitoring levels -agranulocytosis - formula feeds, expressed breast milk, timing feeds 
9. Risk of lithium during breastfeeding and monitoring levels 
10. Liasion: Specialist perinatal service / IVF specialist / obstetrician / midwives / lactation consultant 
She delivers a baby and 3 weeks postnatal, the midwife contacts you concerned about her that she believes that God was telling her that it’s a devil’s child and she is refusing to seek mental health assessment.
2.3 How will you respond to her concerns. (7 marks) - Question is a bit unclear regarding re: setting. Is it at home? Is it advice to midwife only? In exam questions are clearer. The answer will cover basic principles - modify according to the specific question. 
1. Advise that she is displaying symptoms of postnatal psychosis and this is a psychiatric emergency needing urgent assessment. There are significant risks to the mother and baby. However medical risks also need to be ruled out - lithium toxicity with delirium/clozapine rebound/clozapine toxicity with anticholinergic symptoms. 
2. Therefore advise immediate assessment - Where are the mother and baby? Police may need to be called if the patient is refusing engagement and lacks insight. Emergency psychiatric team to attend together. 
3. Collateral from partner or family - Onset of symptoms. evidence of risks, medication compliance 
4. Child protection services - Are they involved? 
5. Assessment - Does the patient fulfil the criteria for admission under MHA? 
Organic causes to be ruled out - sudden cessation of clozapine or lithium or toxicity  
Infection - therefore medical evaluation should also be carried out. 
6. Setting of admission - Mother baby unit with close monitoring or special if needed 

Delusions vs Religious Beliefs 
Marian is diagnosed with Squamous cell carcinoma and the surgeon wants to operate but he is refusing treatment. 
He believes that god will cure him.
Question 1: How will you differentiate psychotic beliefs and religious beliefs / Describe the phenomenology of psychotic vs non-psychotic religious beliefs? (7marks) 
A delusion is a false, unshakeable idea or belief, which is out of keeping with the patient’s educational, cultural and social background; it is held with extraordinary conviction and subjective certainty
1.	Delusion is held without any doubt, but religious belief is held with some doubts or at least an understanding that others could have doubts.
2.	Delusions are concrete/religious views have a degree of abstraction - Religious beliefs are spiritual, abstract, not concrete – ‘God within me' is not experienced as a tactile sensation
3.	Religious beliefs are held with insight - it is understood that others may not share their beliefs.
4.	For religious people, bizarre thoughts and actions do not occur in other areas of life, not connected with religion. Delusional beliefs will often have other delusions in other areas. 
5.	Delusional beliefs are often associated with functional and social impairment / religious beliefs less likely. 
One of the ward nurses knows him from the church group. Registrar asks her to go and talk to his Church member/ family to come and talk to us. The nurse refuses and declines it.
What are the professional issues in the request made by the registrar to the nurse? (10marks)
1.	Autonomy - Patient wishes and decisions are important. Has the patient expressed a wish to convey this to the nurse? If yes does the patient have the capacity to make an informed decision after understanding the risks and benefits of this request? 
2.	Privacy and confidentiality - speaking to the nurse without patient consent constitutes a breach of confidentiality 
3.	Boundary violation - Asking the nurse to convey this to church members is beyond the boundary of usual clinical care. Clear boundaries are essential between the clinical need for information in relation to treatment vs boundary violation. 
4.	Beneficience: Confidential information about patients illness conveyed to their parities - Is this in the patient's best interest? 
5.	Non-maleficence - Can disclosure of information cause harm? - ostracisation from church group/risk to reputation/lack of objectivity by professionals involved 
6.	Registrar supervision: Ethics / good practice/understanding of boundaries in care 

Cultural Scenario
42-year-old married Indonesian woman lives with her husband and their 3-year-old child. She presented following an overdose of 10 tablets of 10mg amitriptyline. She felt hopeless that her physical health will not return to normal functioning.
When you saw her, she was adamant that she was no longer suicidal. She feels depressed, tired, lethargic, predominantly somatically focussed and not able to work as a tutor at university. 
Her husband is not happy that she is not doing any work or looking after her son and this has caused conflict in their relationship.
You see her in the post-overdose clinic.
Husband tells you that he is not happy for her to be followed up by a psychiatrist.
Q1. List and explain possible causes of stigma in this situation
Husband related 
•	Culturally alternative explanatory models of illness
•	Negative attitudes to western models of care
•	Belief in alternative or culturally alternative treatment methods e.g. traditional heling, herbal treatments
•	Strong power imbalance within a male dominated culture
•	Religious beliefs
Treatment-related
•	Lack of trust in services
•	Previous negative experiences with mental health services
•	Distrust of authority
•	Belief treatment will change his wife’s personality or make the situation worse – over-sedated or unable to look after the child
Illness related
•	Belief that mental illness is a sign of weakness
•	Mental illness linked to the patient’s own will – i.e. Wife being ‘lazy’
System-related 
•	Cost of treatment
•	Time away from children
•	Lack of gender matching or cultural/ gender sensitivity

Q2: GP has thoroughly examined and completed investigations and there’s no identifiable cause to explain her somatic symptoms and thinks she is depressed. 
List and explain the possible differential diagnosis
Please note the below points are guidance - please use specific aspects from the vignette to justify the diagnosis. 

Major Depressive Disorder :

Encopresis
You have been referred to see a 6 year old boy, Sam, by his Paediatrician for encopresis. He lives with his mother who is a single mother. The Paediatrician has ruled out any organic issues and has started him on laxatives and a start chart which has not worked.
Outline your assessment of his encopresis. 
1. Multimodal Approach involving Mother, Sam, General practitioner, paediatrician, school and school psychologist of present. It may be helpful to involve father if possible.
2. Sensitive issue and a non-judgemental approach to be adopted so that both mother and Sam do not feel blamed.
3. Risk: high index of suspicion for abuse should be kept at all times which may not be possible to decipher in the first interview. Longitudinal assessments may be required. Observe for any bruises or behaviour that may suggest abuse. May need expertise of psychologist trained in Child health.
4. Contact paediatrician to obtain notes for organic evaluation: Bowel and electrolyte abnormalities, neurological issues with sphincter weakness, Hirschprung's disease, Hypothyroidism. Examination of gait, spina bifida, muscle tone and strength. MRI , Ultrasound carried out. Abdominal examination for masses. Basic examination to be carried out if gaps present.
5. Interview approach: Interview Sam independently and with mother. Interview mother separately as well. Observe parent-child interactions and identify type of attachment (secure, ambivalent, disorganised)
6. Evaluation of encopresis: Age on onset (> 5 years), location (school or home or pervasive), Have siblings had it?, Toilet training methods, response to encopresis: Is punishment used or positive reinforcement? How is mother coping. Is there any violence towards Sam? Height and Weight for Sam.
7. Developmental delay, temperament, illness and trauma exposure. Separation anxiety or any separations when young?
8. Psychosocial issues: Domestic violence, financial stressors, dysfunctional relationship with father.
9. Behavioural Analysis: Antecedents, behaviours and consequences around encopresis
10. Causes for start chart not working: Is it being used consistently? Is positive reinforcement being used? Are the laxatives been administered regularly?
11. Collateral from school: Academic performance, any suspicion of abuse or bullying? Conduct disorder or any parenting concerns.
Sam has not seen his father for some time. His mother has depression and is on antidepressants. His mother said that she is tired of bribing him to behave. When you see Sam, you notice that he has a bruise on his arm. Outline your immediate management plan.
1. Immediate assessment in the emergency department to rule out serious injury e.g. fracture, internal bleeding etc. Full physical examination including ruling out stigmata of abuse or neglect.
2. Consideration of possibility of abuse: Involve a Social worker or child health professional in the assessment as it is a delicate situation and special expertise is required. Child protection services to be informed in case of suspicion of child abuse or neglect is identified (Statutory obligation)
3. Interview approach. Child will need to be interviewed separately and with mother. Mother will also need to be interviewed separately.
4. Adopt a non-judgmental stance and attempt to establish therapeutic alliance with mother. Enquire about her current illness, current coping strategies and her supports. Is she able to meet Sam's needs? Explore what is meant by bribing him? Does she use punishment as a strategy. Has she been violent towards him? What is Sam's relationship with the father. Has his father been violent towards him?
5. Involve specialist child and adolescent services to provide follow up in an out reach model.
6. Seek advice from Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist / Medico-legal insurance / AMA if any legal dilemmas are posed
Principles in responding to suspicion of abuse.
1. Review notes / speak to others/ social workers/ child protection liaison officer to obtain guidance on best way to proceed
2. Approach to child :
•	Stay calm
•	communicate in a way that is age appropriate
•	provide a private and child friendly environment
•	respond in a sensitive and caring manner
•	provide support without being judgemental
•	listen to what the child has to say
•	use open ended questions
•	do not probe for details or ask leading direct questions
•	do not promise confidentiality
•	minimise number of people examining or interviewing
Approach to parents/carers
•	non-judgmental manner
•	no leading questions
•	empathise but not support abusive behaviour
•	keep parents informed of child's medical conditions and needs

It can also present primarily with depression, reckless behavior, agitation , anger, drug and alcohol issues misuse., gambling, thrill seeking behaviour.
2. Assessment needs to be carried out longitudinally and patient to be told that diagnosis may take several appointments and medication is not prescribed lightly.
3. ADHD in adults has a high co-morbidity and other Axis I disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, Drug and alcohol misuse and organic issues should be ruled out before making a conclusive diagnosis of ADHD.
4. Interview James and assess for onset of symptoms. current Symptoms ; inattention, disorganization,, running late etc  Impact of condition of psychosocial functioning. MSE for fidgetiness, pressured speech etc. 
5. Drug and Alcohol history: Current use / Previous dependence history/ Treatment and motivation to abstain.
6. Neurological examination and organic screening to rule out :developmental delay, thyroid dysfunction, Vit B12 and folate deficiency, MRI if neurological issues identified. Sleep disturbances (insomnia, OSA, REM sleep movement disorder), Pain. ECG
7. Personality assessment: Rule out antisocial personality disorder and childhood conduct disorder.
8. Collateral information from school, family to corroborate onset of symptoms: School reports. Impulsivity, inattention and hyperactivity, pervasive and across settings (home, school, playground etc.)
9. ADHD scale - ASRS (ADHD self-report scale / CADDRA/ DIVA). 
Some symptoms you can add from the following list to show presentations in adults - add this in the current symptom domain (Please note you only need 5-6 of below - be mindful of time )

James has had difficulties in the social and occupational aspects of his life. He had been using his brother's methylphenidate with good effect. He has lost jobs in the past due to drug use. What are the main issues and how will you address them?
1. Risk: Explain to James that misusing his brother's medication can be dangerous and is not advised. Inform James that you will need to inform family as there is a risk of harm to his brother and that medication will need to be restricted.
2. Medico-legal issues:  The brother's GP need to be informed as there is a risk to child. Seek advice from M-L insurance to assess any additional medico-legal requirement. 
3. Longitudinal assessment : Advise James that an assessment for ADHD is longitudinal and medication may not be prescribed at this appointment.
4. Rule out Substance use and antisocial personality disorder.
5. What is his motivation to seek treatment?
6. Potential for diversion and misuse of medication 
7. Potential for accidental overdose if combined with other drugs
8. If treatment prescribed explain treatment contract: Script cannot be reissued if lost. Random drug tests. Obtain medication from same pharmacy. Medication will be ceased if any diversion or non-benefit noted.
9. Contact doctor shopping site to see if any other prescriptions are obtained.
You have been asked to give a talk to a group of GP's regarding Adult ADHD. 
Outline what you would discuss. (In the exam they could also ask you the approach)
1. If approach asked then consider educator role :
Survey the audience. Is it GP's or Registrars as well?
Pre-existing knowledge or asking then what they would like covered in a survey.
Audio-visual presentations, didactic and interactive learning based on principles of adult learning e.g case studies
2. Scholar Role:
•	ADHD presents atypically in adults. Inattention and concentration may persist in adulthood whilst hyperactivity and impulsivity reduces which makes diagnosis difficult.
•	Strong family history may be present.
•	Conduct disorder may be present in childhood
•	ADHD is highly co-morbid and hence other disorders should be ruled out before conclusive diagnosis is made
3. Clinician role:
•	Presenting symptoms may be : aggression, irritability, depression, recklessness, poor work performance, procrastination etc.
•	Rule out Depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis and substance use.
•	Treatment options : Medication and Psychological strategies
•	Medication consists of stimulants and non-stimulants
•	Side effects and evaluation (ECG, cardiology review)
•	When to refer to psychiatrist? and Referral pathways. Resources available.
4. Professional role:
•	Medico-legal obligations around stimulant prescribing (Schedule 8 restricted drug)
•	Doctor-patient treatment contract
What are the issues in prescribing of medication in Adult ADHD
Question 2 What are the Issues in prescribing medication in Adult ADHD. 
 
1.	Pre-treatment
•	Diagnostic clarification. ADHD in adults is often comorbid and hence comorbidity should be treated optimally. Second opinion
•	Use ADHD questionnaires e.g ADHD Self-report scale 
•	CADDRA or DIVA questionnaire
•	Collateral information and school reports are an important part of assessment 
•	Medical evaluation to rule out cardiac disease
•	History of psychosis or substance use that may be relative contraindications or cautions for use of stimulants 
Treatment issues : 
•	First line treatment is stimulant. 
•	Methylphenidate or dexamphetamine that come as immediate or extended release is evidence based 
•	Monitor for side effects - Stimulants can increase anxiety, lead to insomnia or agitation and loss of appetite 
•	Tics can occur and may need clonidine or guanfacine either as single agent or in combination
•	Start low and go slow. Maximum doses 60 mg of Methylphenidate and Dexamphetamine. Lisdexamfetamine also available 
Medicolegal aspects : 
•	Authority prescribing – Important to check local prescribing medicolegal regulations for example S8 authority
•	Bupropion is evidence-based if non-stimulant is needed 
Post-treatment: 
•	Monitor for risk of diversion / comorbid substance use 
•	Monitor weight and BP 
•	ECG 6 monthly as needed 
•	If prescription misuse is suspected – check with prescription shopping programs e.g. safe script

Depression in Pregnancy
You are a psychiatric registrar working in a Community Mental Health Centre. You are asked to review Justine, a 32 year old female, recently married with no children, working full time as a medical secretary. Justine has recently told the practice nurse (at her local medical centre) that she would like to become pregnant. 
She has been hospitalised twice in the past, including an episode after a suicide attempt five years ago. She has been well for two years. She is prescribed paroxetine, 40 mg daily, and has no significant side effects. 
Justine has been referred by her General Practitioner, having previously been treated at the CMHT for recurrent major depression. 
Outline your approach to the interview with Justine .
1. Process of interview with Justine: See Justine on her own to explore wishes and concerns; invite partner to the interview to elicit longitudinal and corroborative information. 
2. Importance of planning the pregnancy - When does the patient want to start planning? Is the patient currently on contraception or is the partner using contraception? (If the question asked about what advice you would give - then it is important to tell the patient about planning the pregnancy. Discuss contraception and then go on to advise the risk-benefit analysis) 
3. Review Justine’s past history: Her mental state when not taking medication, response to other antidepressant medication, symptoms of hypomania or mania.The severity of illness, Risk of harm to self or others. Current capacity to make decisions. 
4. Assess Justine’s current mental state: Current mood (euthymic, depressed or hypomanic), judgement, insight, risk assessment. Current risk.
5. Discussion of treatment of depression in pregnancy: Risks of treatment with antidepressants in pregnancy and breastfeeding, risks of no treatment, provision of written materials, non-pharmacological treatments, assessing Justine’s and her partner’s attitudes to treatment.
•	Paroxetine is associated with PPHN in 3rd-trimester exposure. 
•	Neonatal withdrawal syndrome 
•	Safe antidepressants - sertraline / escitalopram
•	Risk of withdrawal symptoms with reduction and cessation of paroxetine. Gradual tapering is required. This may take up 3-6 months in some patients. 
•	Risk of depression in pregnancy - neglect, suicide risk, attachment and bonding impacts 
6. Liaison issues : explain that a pregnancy will require liaison with obstetrician/midwife/ high risk pregnancy service. Role of GP, Perinatal psychiatry service. 
7. Follow up arrangements: Arrange follow up appointment within a short time frame to discuss their concerns/ decision. Advise contraception until decision is made. 
Note - In the exam they can ask about IVF - patient wants to go ahead with IVF. outline key issues - similar aspects apply - but capacity to make decisions and parenting capacity aspects will be important as part of whole process. 
Also, it is especially important to focus on past history and current mental state. Current level of unwellness will be important 
Furthermore - IVF involves hormone Rx - impact on mental illness - worsening monitoring/stress of IVF and relapse. 
Collaborative approach with IVF specialist / psychological support (specialised psychologists in this area) 
Other components remain the same - Risk-benefit analysis. Risk-benefit analysis of IVF as above and Risk-benefit analysis of the psychiatric medication and illness.

Indigenous Psychiatry
Mr. Davies is a 60 year old Aboriginal man with chronic paranoid schizophrenia. He lives with his son, daughter-in-law and 2 grandchildren (3 and 5 years old). He is on a flupenthixol depot 20 mg IM 2 weekly and has been managed in the community. In the past when unwell, he has responded to an increased dose in his medications. He has a past history of verbal aggression and paranoia toward the neighbours. Recently, a member of the family passed away and Mr. Davies' psychotic symptoms worsened - he started expressing more paranoid persecutory ideation regarding his neighbours trying to poison him. He thinks that the only way to solve this is to smoke them by burning their houses. He also thinks that his 4 year-old grandson, Tyler, is trying to poison him. Mr Davies has lost weight as a result of this.
List the risks inherent in the scenario. (Please justify if outline is asked with evidence from vignette)
1. Risk of harm to child : He has persecutory delusions against the 4 year old.
2. Risk of harm to self e.g. suicide or self harm : Grief leading to depression with psychosis
3. Risk of harm to neighbours
3. Medical risk: Self neglect, poor appetite and dehydration. (Loss of weight)
4. Risk of re-feeding syndrome during treatment
5. Risk to reputation with subsequent stigma
6. Risk of disengagement with community services and risk of worsening mental state
7. Risk of misdiagnosis: Cultural elements may be present secondary to grief.
Mr. Davies' son thinks that you need to increase the dose of Mr. Davies depot as this worked in the past. (The son wants the father to be managed at home. He believes he can convince his father to take some oral medications (Olanzapine). You agree to the plan. However, the Aboriginal liaison worker thinks that this is a normal cultural response to a death in the family and not a relapse of schizophrenia. He feels patient should not be managed with medication, that he should be managed with traditional healing instead and wants to involve a traditional healer.
The outline you approach the situation: 
Patient first; Listen and understand reasons for the decision; then psychoeducation
1. Assess Mr Davies current mental state and capacity to make decisions (autonomy). If Mr Davies lacks capacity and there is a risk of harm to self or others then the family should be informed that a mental health act assessment will need to be carried out. (Clinician and Professional Role)
2. If Mr Davies has capacity then ask for his wishes with regards to treatment. Arrange a meeting with Mr Davies, his son and traditional healer to clarify concerns. (Collaborator role). Understand the reasons why they want a traditional healer involved. 
3. Approach the situation in a non-judgemental manner and aim to establish a therapeutic alliance. Recognise the importance of cultural practices but at the same time provide psychoeducation about the importance of treatment and risks associated with illness. (Collaborator and educator role)
4. Explain that both treatments can co-exist. Clarify if traditional healing practices would mean that antipsychotic medication would need to be stopped. (Clinician role). Any interactions with psychiatric medications? 
5. Explain the risks of non-treatment of schizophrenia. Explain the risk and benefits of medications. Explain role of mental health clinicians 
6. Involvement of community elders as needed to build trust
Mr. Davies' son approaches you as his wife wants to leave the family home as she feels threatened by Mr. Davies. He has been looking suspiciously at the grandchildren. Mr Davies' son feels torn between his loyalties to his wife and father. He asks for your advice. 

Outline your approach.
1. Arrange a meeting and listen to Son's and wife's concerns: Take a non-judgmental approach and establish a therapeutic alliance. Rule out the risk to children. If risk to children is present immediate assessment and admission may need to be considered. Legislative requirements (e.g MHA assessment) 
2. Explain that priority is to treat Mr Davies' illness. Explain to the family that behaviour is driven by mental illness and that adequate treatment of mental illness could allow Mr Davies to return home safely.
Short term Separation (e.g admission)  may be necessary as part of treatment due to risks involved. Admission under the Mental health act may be required if Mr Davies' lacks capacity and risk is significant. 
3. Provide psychoeducation about the illness and that the situation may change once the illness is treated.
4. Involve Indigenous liaison worker
5. Consider overnight leave to assess the situation at home
5. Arrange to follow up meetings to assess the situation at regular intervals.



	
CTO and Ethics 
26 year male with Hx of Schizoaffective disorder and Meth dependence.
