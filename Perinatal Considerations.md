## Approach
- **Risk assessment**: harm if untreated vs harm of treatment
  - Psychoeducation of below
  - Untreated psychiatric illness
    - Independent risk factor for stillbirths, malformations and deaths
    - Increases risk of pre-term delivery = direct increased risk of major mental illness in child
    - Can have psychological consequences on child's development
    - Late pregnancy and postpartum period is a risk factor for increased relapse
    - Standard risks of harm to self (mother) and children (particularly infanticide, neglect, misadventure) with untreated psychiatric illness
  - Psychotropics in pregnancy
    - Difficult to study due to ethics of prospective studies = poor evidence quality
    - Minimal evidence regarding long-term outcomes
- Management considerations
  - **All potential child-bearing women**:
    - Avoid teratogens ie. valproate or carbamazepine
    - Psychoeducation if above have to be used as last resort
  - General principles
    - Use lowest effective dose
    - Prioritise low-risk medications
    - Minimise number of medications if possible
  - **Antenatal**:
    - Optimise lifestyle measures
      - Cease substances (EtOH, smoking)
      - Optimise diet, lose weight
    - Medications: always subject to your risk assessment
      - Avoid in first trimester if possible as organs are being created
      - If low risk, consider discontinuing medications
      - If high risk, consider switching to a low-risk medication
      - If already taking medications and finds out pregnant, might as well continue. Abrupt discontinuation increases risk of relapse, however known teratogens should be stopped ie. valproate
  - **Postnatal**
  - **Breastfeeding**
- Follow-up
  - Refer to specialist perinatal services
  - Ensure adequate foetal screening
  - Monitor for neonatal withdrawal

## Background Information
- Baseline rates
  - Spontaneous abortion in early pregnancy: 10-20%
  - Spontaneous major malformation: 2-3%
- Physiological changes in pregnancy
  - Increased blood volume tf may require dose uptitration
  - Hepatic enzyme activity changes tf may require dose titration

## Antidepressants

## Antipsychotics
- Risk factors for postpartum psychosis
  - Psychosis in pregnancy
  - Bipolar disorder
  - Family Hx of postpartum psychosis
  - Personal Hx of postpartum psychosis
- Postpartum psychosis is 0.1-0.25% in normal population
- Approaches
  - Note drug-induced hyperprolactinaemia can prevent pregnancy
  - Use something that works ie. previous efficacy. Avoids exposure to multiple agents.
  - Switching 
- Medication choices
  - FGA
    - Increases risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. 20% of exposed neonates have early somnolence and jitteriness.
    - No meaningful increased risk of major or cardiac malformations
    - Possible association though low-risk of limb defects
    - Chlorpromazine has reports of neonatal jaundice
  - SGA
    - Increases birth weight and/or cardiac septal defects. 15% of exposed neonates have withdrawal effects.
    - No meaningful increased risk of major or cardiac malformations
    - Increased risk of gestational diabetes, caesarean section, LGA, preterm birth
    - Risk seems highest with olanzapine, better with aripiprazole
    - Clozapine may also increase risk of neonatal seizures but is otherwise safe
    - Caripiprazine has been recommended by manufactuers to not be used
    - Unclear evidence about long-term development goals

## Anxiolytics

## Mood Stabilisers


## Summary

- FGA
  - Relatively safe
- SGA
  - Relatively safe
