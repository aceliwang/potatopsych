### MEQ 3.2 Discuss your differential diagnosis. (6 marks)

- Benzodiazepine withdrawal (lorazepam) with abrupt cessation
- Other substance intoxication or withdrawal including alcohol
- Other causes of delirium including infection, constipation or polypharmacy or post-operative period
- Parkinson's disease, ongoing neurodegeneration or secondary to dopaminergic medications
- Late-onset schizophrenia
- Temporal lobe epilepsy
- Psychotic depression

### MEQ 3.3 Write down your medication advice for the medical team. (8 marks)

- Benzodiazepine management
  - Long-term lorazepam usage necessitates weaning especially depending on dose
  - Likely requires recommencement of benzodiazepines with transition to long-acting versions + tapering plan depending on indication
  - Consult with drug and alcohol services with likely tapering plan and availability of PRN benzodiazepines to manage withdrawal
  - Typically to prevent prolonged delirium, benzodiazepines should be avoided, however in this case it is utilised to manage her withdrawal
- Balance of Parkinson's medications and antipsychotics
  - Decrease Parkinson's medications to lowest tolerable dose in context of motor symptoms
  - Commencement of low-dose antipsychotics with low propensity for extra-pyramidal symptoms such as quetiapine and then clozapine if required
  - Consideration of usage of cholinesterase inhibitors due to cognitive impairment secondary to Parkinson's dementias
