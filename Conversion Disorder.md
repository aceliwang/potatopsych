# Conversion Disorder

Epidemiology, aetiology (biopsychosocial, cultural), symptomatology, course, assessment, management (biopsychosocial, cultural), psychiatric and medical comorbidities, differential diagnoses.

## Definition and aetiology
- Neurological impairment without structural cause
- Typically in context of acute stressors
  - Conflict is unconsiously converted into physical symptoms for primary gain
  - "Double bind" essentially a Catch-22 leads to physical manifestation
- Also known as functional neurological disorder


## Epidemiology
- Female to male ratio of 2-10:1
- Onset typically occurs at younger ages although can occur throughout the life cycle
- Risk factors
  - Physical disorders in others to which they can model
  - Severe social stressors including psychosocial trauma
- Prognostic factors
  - Acute and recent onset
  - Traumatic stressor as an onset
  - Good premorbid physical and psychological health

## Symptomatology
- Sudden onset following psychosocial stressors ie. the "bind"
  - Motor
    - Weakness / paralysis
    - Aphonia
    - Seizure
  - Sensory
    - Blindness
    - Double vision
- Symptoms are more often found on the left side in women


## Assessment
- Conversion disorder requires a precipitating stressor
  - You essentially want to avoid an organic cause being detected after a diagnosis of conversion disorder
  - 12-50% of conversion disorder ultimately found an organic cause

## Management
- Spontaneous remission is common
- Psychotherapy
  - Supportive if conflict / stressor is identifiable
  - Rapid response to acute cases but not chronic
  - Direct confrontation is not effective
