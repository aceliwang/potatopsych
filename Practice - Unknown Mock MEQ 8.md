## MEQ 5

Maria, aged 25 years, has a history of epilepsy since early childhood with multiple seizure types, a poor response to anticonvulsants, and longstanding cognitive difficulties (her full-scale IQ is 65). She lives with her parents in a small country town, and intermittently attends a supported work program packing boxes of fruit. She was admitted in status epilepticus to a tertiary intensive care unit and was ventilated for 3 days. Two days ago, she was transferred to the neurology ward. Since waking up she has been telling her parents that "everyone is spying on me with satellite cameras", and that the nursing staff are saying horrible things about her. She is worried that the food is poisoned. You are asked by the neurology team to see Maria.

### MEQ 5.1 Discuss the information you would seek prior to seeing Maria. Please give reasons for your answers. (10 marks)

### MEQ 5.2 Give your differential diagnoses with a reason for each diagnosis. (6 marks)

### MEQ 5.3 The neurologist is happy for Maria to remain under her care as the risk of further seizures is quite high. However, the nursing ward staff have now become anxious about managing Maria on the neurology ward because they feel she is "crazy" and may be a danger to the other sick patients. Describe how you would address the nursing staff's concerns. (7 marks)

## MEQ 6

36yo man developed schizophrenia at age 18yo. His case manager asks you to reassess him & do a report to support the extension of his 4th CTO.

## MEQ 6.4 The patient has worked in a 4 year position as a radio presenter & asks you if you would come into the radio station & do an interview with him about a breaking news story on a recent inpatient discharged who went on to commit a violent murder. What ethical considerations would you think about before agreeing to or refusing this interview? (6 marks)
