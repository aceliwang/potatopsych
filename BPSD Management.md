# Management
- Approach
  - Exclude superimposed delirium ie. physical examination and 
- Biological: symptomatic
  - Analgesics
    - Agitation may be secondary to pain
    - Simple analgesia can be trialled relatively safely
  - Antipsychotics
    - Choices
      - Short courses of risperidone or olanzapine for severe distress and/or serious risk of harm to staff
        - Risperidone: 0.5mg BD
      - Attempt tapering if possible at 6 weeks, 3 months and every 6 months
    - Should be discussed with carers and patients if possible 
    - Limitations
      - Small effect size
      - Poor tolerability
      - Increased mortality (strokes). Haloperidol has highest association with mortality.
  - As per Maudsley
    - Cognitive enhancers can improve BPSD albeit take up to several weeks to work
    - Avoid benzos
    - SSRIs can be used if depressed
    - Limited evidence for mood-stabilisers
    - Nil harm with melatonin
    - ECT has some evidence suggesting good effect albeit concern of further cognitive impairment
- Psychological
  - TOP5
