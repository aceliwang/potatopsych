# What are BPSDs?

- Definition: catch-all of non-cognitive symptoms in dementia
- Behavioural examples: agitation, aggression, sleep-wake cycle disturbance
  - 60-90% of dementia cases
- Psychological examples: psychosis, anxiety, depression, apathy (55-90%)
  - 25% of dementia cases
- Typically communication of unmet needs

# Taking a look at dementias
- 7.8% of over 65 yos have dementia
- Earlier onset in ATSI
- Cognitive manifestations
  - Complex attention
  - Learning and memory
  - Language
  - Perceptual-motor
  - Executive dysfunction
  - Social cognition
- Stages
  - Prodromal: not very engaged, early issues with memory and complex tasks
  - Moderate: more obvious cognitive issues, likely with aggression. BPSDs most commonly start here.
  - Terminal: 24/7 care required due to lack of ADLs

# Management
- Approach
  - Principles
    - Person-centred and trauma-informed care
    - Multidisciplinary approaches
    - Emphasis on ethicolegal responsibilities
  - Biological
    - (1) Exclude superimposed delirium ie. physical examination, consider unmet needs
    - Limit psychotropics if able. Last-line after BSP is unsuccessful
      - Antipsychotics should be used at a maximum 12 weeks, should be reviewed regularly
      - Low and slow
      - Should be targeting symptoms
  - Psychosocial
    - Consider safety and setting of care
    - Behavioural support plan (communication particularly tone and body language, minimising stimuli, optimising sleep and environment)
    - Psychological and social engagement, exclusion of psychiatric disorders
      - Emotional responses to change including separation from comfort zone and people
    - Communicate with all stakeholders particularly carers
    - Early discharge planning in regards to setting
  - Ongoing monitoring and review
- Biological: symptomatic
  - As per NSW Health Handbook
    - Analgesics
      - Agitation may be secondary to pain
      - Simple analgesia can be trialled relatively safely eg. paracetamol
    - Antidepressant
      - For non-urgent agitation, aggression or psychosis or severe depression
      - Escitalopram 5-10mg or citalopram 10-20mg (lower amount of drug interactions)
      - Sertraline 25-100mg if QTc is prolonged
    - Cognitive enhancers
      - Particularly in DLB
      - Aimed at preventing as opposed to treating, with main focus on depression, anxiety and apathy
      - Rivastigmine patches 4.6-9.5mg, donepezil 5-10mg, galantamine 8-16mg
      - Rivastigmine and donepezil can decrease visual hallucinations and delusions
      - Symptoms tend to worsen with withdrawal, should be continued lifelong
    - Antipsychotics
      - For psychosis and aggression in AD or any other dementia other than DLB
      - Risperidone 0.25-2mg or aripiprazole 2.5-15mg ???
      - Increased risk of stroke, confusion and EPSE
    - Benzos
      - For once-off doses for severe anxiety or to provide sedation
      - Eg. lorazepam 0.5-1mg, oxazepam 15-30mg
    - Mood stabilisers
      - For agitation
      - Carbamazepine is the only one that has good evidence
      - Requires OPMH input
  - As per Maudsley
    - Cognitive enhancers can improve BPSD albeit take up to several weeks to work
    - Antipsychotics
      - Choices
        - Short courses of risperidone or olanzapine for severe distress and/or serious risk of harm to staff
          - Risperidone: 0.5mg BD
        - Attempt tapering if possible at 6 weeks, 3 months and every 6 months
      - Should be discussed with carers and patients if possible 
      - Limitations
        - Small effect size
        - Poor tolerability
        - Increased mortality (strokes). Haloperidol has highest association with mortality.
    - Avoid benzos
    - SSRIs can be used if depressed
    - Limited evidence for mood-stabilisers
    - Nil harm with melatonin
    - ECT has some evidence suggesting good effect albeit concern of further cognitive impairment
  - Newer agents
    - Pimavanserin
- Psychosocial
  - Maintain safety
  - Modify communication
    - Enhance senses if possible
  - Modify environment
    - Maximise orientation
    - 1:1 special for ongoing monitoring
  - Modify activity: personalised interests
  - Strategies
    - Behaviour management: diversional ideas (essentially occupy their time)
    - Aromatherapy
    - Music
    - Validation/reminiscence therapy
    - Sleep hygiene: comfortable bed and environment, avoiding stimuli before bed, avoiding sleeping during the day, physical activity during the day
  - ABC assessment: antecedent, behaviour, consequences
- ATSI considerations
  - Similar to other mental illness
  - Greater consideration for family and community centred care
- CALD considerations
  - People regress in their language leading to loss of English
  - Utilise bilingual staff (care providers) and interpreters if possible
- Other strategies
  - TOP5: talk to the carer, obtain information, personalise care, develop 5 strategies
  - Sunflower Tool
  - Content for MEQ
    - Maximise residual strengths with task modification, providing equipment
    - Working with carers and families for person-centred care
    - Supporting the carer with social supports, ACAT, finances and psychoeducation

## Agitation +/- Aggression
- Either verbal or physical in nature with or without aggression
  - Verbal: constant clinginess, repeated questions, health complaints, moaning
    - Aggressive: swearing, temper outbursts, verbal intimidation
  - Physical: restlessness, wandering, inappropriate dressing, intrusiveness
    - Aggressive: hitting, kicking, pushing, scratching, inappropriate sexual behaviour
- Common in the case of "catastrophic reactions" with sudden onset due to misinterpretations or frustration regarding disability

## Nocturnal Disruption
- Common in all
- Abnormal movements with REM sleep disorders are associated with DLB

## Inappropriate Sexual Behaviour
- Identify cause including misidentification of people
- Exclude underlying psychiatric issues eg. mania
- Can be caused by absence of partners, unfamiliar environments, alcohol use, misinterpretation of physical care
- Consider baseline sexual behaviour prior to onset

## Anxiety
- Incidence: 16-35% of dementia
- Involves fears of social isolation, generalised anxiety and concerns about finances, the future or health

## Apathy
- Incidence: 55-90% of dementia
- Nil mood or neurovegetative symptoms (thus not depression)
- Essentially nil spontaneity but would respond to prompting

## Depression
- Incidence: 20% of dementia
- Difficult to diagnose in later stages
- Depressive symptoms may be caused by dementia itself
- More common in vascular and Parkinson's dentia

## Psychosis
- Incidence: 25% of dementia
- Common delusional themes include Capgras, persecutory and Othello syndrome
- Hallucinations are more commonly visual as opposed to auditory
  - Note auditory illusions ie. misinterpretations are common

## Behavioural Emergency Management
- Oral options
  - Lorazepam 0.5-1mg, up to 5mg
  - Olanzapine 5-10mg, up to 10mg
  - Risperidone 0.5-1mg up to 2mg
- IM options
  - Olanzapine 2.5mg IM, avoiding if delirious (? due to hypotensive effect)
- Seclusion and restraint
  - Restraint is associated with further decline, increased mortality and possible increase in dementia
  - Seclusion likely causes agitation with increase in falls
  - Only as last-resort

## Ethicolegal Considerations

- Dementia does not equal no capacity
- If consent cannot be obtained
  - Written consent required from Person Responsible for Major Treatment (which includes antipsychotics) otherwise NCAT

## COVERT ADMINISTRATION
