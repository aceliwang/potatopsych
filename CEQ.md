Psychiatry is unique in medicine in that there remains robust debate about the nature of, and existence of, the diseases it seeks to treat. This discourse extends beyond the academic sphere, and is amplified within consumers and carers. The stimulus suggests that "diagnosis is a useful form of communication" however that "it is not a fact".

This essay will explore how {} from my personal perspective as a psychiatry trainee and more broadly within the mental health system.**

Firstly, understandings of illness have been subject to centuries of historical and sociocultural influence however continue to vary in present day, shaped by consumers' individual context and their lived experience. 

Diagnostic frameworks have existed and evolved since the Ancient Egyptian Book of Hearts as evidenced through the iterative DSM editions from psychoanalytic, to neurobiological, to reverse-nosological conceptual understandings of disease (Aftab, 2021). Diagnostic terms are thus neither fixed nor universal and the dangers of utilising diagnoses as "facts" can be observed historically in the Rosenhan experiment (1973) which relied upon then-considered objective diagnostic criteria to institutionalise and dehumanise those assessed as mentally ill. 

These flaws frequently appear when clinical diagnoses are employed in legal, forensic and insurance settings, reducing consumers to labels and ignoring the true extent of their psychological distress and functional impairment (RANZCP position statement 77). Furthermore, diagnoses can be exploited to desecrate human rights as evidenced by the use of the diagnosis "sluggish schizophrenia" to suppress political dissidents previously in the Soviet Union.

From a principalist ethics perspective, a non-"factual" approach could be observed as non-maleficent. Diagnostic labels, treated as "facts", can impose harms of stigmatisation and dehumanisation. ???

Ultimately, although the development of systematic diagnostic frameworks have provided the capacity to structure and develop management guidelines for mental illness, it is also important to be aware of the disadvantages that such diagnoses impose upon patients.

**Despite acknowledging the errors and harms imposed by historical practice (RANZCP position statement 84), psychiatry continues to face criticism for its over-reliance on operational criteria and over-medicalisation of ???.**

Alternative experiences of illness also arise from different cultural contexts. Non-Western cultures, such as Maori, focus on holistic models of health with greater considerations of familial and spiritual factors.

Current practice guidelines and diagnostic systems such as the DSM-5-TR stem majorly from data collected in Western nations.

(RANZCP Position Statement 105)

Regarding diagnoses as "facts" can lead to ignorance of Non-Western cultures, for example Maori, which place a greater emphasis on the family unit and respect to spiritual factors.

Finally, lack of insight or anosognosia is common in schizophrenia-spectrum illnesses, presenting barriers against shared decision making.

**subsequent disagreement between the clinician and consumer. However, pathways towards recovery can endure.**

Rigid commitments to diagnoses as "facts" magnifies the paternalistic nature of historical psychiatric practice and threatens the therapeutic alliance central to recovery.

This is highlighted as the core necessity to successful therapy as per RANZCP clinical guidelines for mood disorders.

Early training rotations as an inpatient registrar were overwhelmingly comprised of biological managements for acute diagnoses ie. consumers with psychotic relapses were treated with antipsychotic medications. Such involuntary management, compounded by restrictive environments, are often highly traumatising and can be counter-therapeutic due to removal of their existing supports. Subsequently, further time in community and rehabilitation roles have highlighted the negative impacts of traditional models of care towards consumers and their recovery process. 

Adoption of strategies from the Open Dialogue Model (Sekkila et al, 1990s) by conducting team discussions and reflections in the presence of consumers and carers, provides opportunity to promote patient centred care and limited enhancement of autonomy within the involuntary setting irrespective of diagnostic concordance. Such shared-decision practice reaffirms our roles as a collaborator and advocate (CANMEDS, 2015)
