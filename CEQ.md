<!-- Introduction: 79/150 words
Could define diagnosis -->

Psychiatry is unique in medicine in that there remains robust debate about the nature of, and existence of, the diseases it seeks to treat. This discourse extends beyond the academic sphere, and is amplified within consumers and carers which can lead to poor therapeutic alliance and complicates the recovery process. **Define terms** This essay shall explore the impacts of **utilising diagnoses as "facts"** and the progress psychiatry is undergoing including trauma-informed and recovery-orientated approaches to facilitate recovery, from my personal perspective as a psychiatric trainee and as part of the mental health system.

Ethical and historical

Understandings of illness have been subject to centuries of historical and sociocultural influence and are further shaped by consumers' individual lived experience. The concept of mental disorders have existed since ancient Mesopotomia (Parys, 2014) and diagnostic frameworks have evolved over time as evidenced through the iterative editions of the DSM from psychoanalytic, to neurobiological, to reverse-nosological conceptual understandings of disease (Aftab, 2021). Diagnostic terms and labels for mental disorders are thus neither fixed nor universal and if not constantly scrutinised can lead to irrevocable harms as observed with the historical dehumanisation and stigmatisation of those identifying as homosexual. 99

Thus, from a principle-based ethics perspective, the diagnostic process must be conducted with care in recognition of the vast implications of its outcomes. Although mental illness can be diagnosed, in line with beneficent principles to direct biopsychosocial management and unlock essential supports and resources, the duty of non-maleficence requires psychiatrists to consider the extensive ramifications of diagnosis, particularly when misused within the legal, forensic and insurance settings which reduce consumers to labels and ignore the true extent of their psychological distress and functional impairment (RANZCP Position Statement 77). At its worst, psychiatric diagnoses have been used to violate individuals' autonomy as evidenced by the use of "sluggish schizophrenia" to suppress political dissidents in the Soviet Union historically. 

Reflection upon past errors supported by the psychiatric field reinforces the recommitment to ethics and the need for psychiatrists to advocate upon those deemed mentally ill and to strive towards elimination of discrimination against our consumers (RANZCP Code of Ethics 11).

Concomitantly, alternative experiences of illness can arise from different cultural contexts. For example, the First Nations people prioritise a holistic model of health, with greater consideration of familial and spiritual well-being. However, current practice guidelines and diagnostic systems such as the DSM-5-TR have been primarily developed from data collected in Western nations and implementing this medical model of mental illness upon marginalised groups including the Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD), Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Others (LGBTQ+) and First Nations populations not only ignores critical aspects of their concept of health, but also reinforces the power imbalances present from historical oppression eg. the Stolen Generation which manifest both in outcomes ie. increased rates of psychoses and suicides and also higher rates of discrimination as reflected within the disproportional rates of involuntary assessments and incarceration of the First Nations people.

Reconciliation of the intergenerational trauma and lived experience of First Nations people thus **highlights the need and appreciation for individualised care**. 

Fortunately, this has been recognised by the incorporation of trauma-informed principles into practice (RANZCP Position Statement 100) and the introduction of peer support workers and Aboriginal Liaison Officers into multidisciplinary care represent a shift towards cultural sensitivity and holistic care (RANZCP Position Statement 50), in line with the recovery model.

Thus, it is important to prioritise the integration of cultural safety, **acknowledging the shortcomings of applying conventional models of care**, to support the wellbeing of different cultural groups including Indigenous communities, their Elders and beyond.

Finally, public psychiatry is encompassed by schizophrenia-spectrum illnesses where lack of insight or anosognosia is common, leading to **barriers against shared decision making** and cultivation of the therapeutic alliance. The latter is recognised as a central tenet to the recovery process (RANZCP CPG for Mood Disorders), however may be set aside in the pursuit of biological management as experienced in my early training rotations in inpatient roles. Such involuntary management compounded by restrictive environments and potential paranoia and perceptual disturbances is often highly traumatising and although can lead to short-term "improvement", more often impairs consumers' ability and motivation to participate in long-term preventative care and rehabilitation, perpetuating a vicious cycle of re-traumatisation when they become unwell. 

Adoption of Open Dialogue Model strategies (Sekkila et al, 1990s) by conducting team discussions and reflections in the presence of consumers and carers, provides opportunity to promote patient centred care and limited enhancement of autonomy within the involuntary setting, in line with the recovery model **irrespective of diagnostic concordance between consumer and clinician**. Participation in Balint groups has developed appreciation of the impact and harms of traditional paternalistic practice and reaffirms our roles as a collaborator and advocate (CANMEDS, 2015) to participating in and promoting shared-decision making. Affording consumers the dignity of risk (Ibrahim and Davis, 2014) in care decisions, can lead to development of insight, promoting empowerment and advocacy and enhance the therapeutic alliance. **needs a concluding sentence**

<!-- Conclusion:92/75 words -->

In conclusion, it is important to recognise the complex and multi-faceted nature of psychiatry that extends beyond conventional medical models of assessment, diagnosis and management. **Focusing only on "diagnostic facts" neglects the holistic picture and can damage the therapeutic alliance, disempower consumers and complicate the recovery process.** Psychiatry has evolved in its shift towards patient-centered care as reflected within the implementation of trauma-informed principles, cultural safety and recovery-orientated strategies and demonstrates the requirement for ongoing examination and scrutinisation of its practice to provide benefit to its consumers and society as a whole.

## Historical

From a principalist ethics perspective, such an approach to diagnosis could be observed to align with non-maleficence. When diagnostic labels are treated as "facts", there is a risk of imposing iatrogenic harm by introducing stigmatisation and facilitating dehumanisation as demonstrated above and would be against providing the best attainable care (RANZCP Code of Ethics Principle 3). Thus caution should be applied in the diagnostic and management process.  

Despite acknowledging the errors and harms imposed by historical practice (RANZCP position statement 84), psychiatry continues to be scrutinised for its diagnostic process and operational criteria, more recently regarding overmedicalisation of normal human behaviour. **and in the context of the relationship between psychiatry and pharmaceutical companies. (not sure how well this flows)**




Ultimately, although the development of systematic diagnostic frameworks have provided the capacity to structure and develop management guidelines for mental illness, it is important to understand that it is not absolute and the cruciality of this for ethical practice.


These flaws frequently appear when clinical diagnoses are employed in legal, forensic and insurance settings, reducing consumers to labels and ignoring the true extent of their psychological distress and functional impairment (RANZCP position statement 77). Furthermore, diagnoses can be exploited to desecrate human rights as evidenced by the use of the diagnosis "sluggish schizophrenia" to suppress political dissidents previously in the Soviet Union. 


## Cultural

For example, the medical profession was complicit in designing racist, paternalistic and discriminatory government policies leading to the forced removal of children ie. the Stolen Generations. The intergenerational trauma secondary to these policies led to displacement, institutionalisation and cultural disconnection, with enduring stigmatising and reductive labels that manifest in First Nations people today (RANZCP Position Statement 105). These manifest through higher rates of diagnoses of psychosis, suicides and incarcerations within the First Nations people but also reflect the barriers to how conventional Western models of care are not adapted to support the wellbeing of Indigenous communities and their Elders. **Similar to Rachel's**

**Highlights the nature of spirituality, kinship and and cultural connection**



Fortunately, there has been a shift towards addressing these previous barriers. These include increasing Aboriginal Liaison Officers and inclusion of peer workers into multidiscplinary care which represent a shift away from merely addressing a diagnosis and incorporating holistic care, in line with both the recovery model and RANZCP Position Statement 50. Furthermore, the DSM-5-TR has made revisions to incorporate cultural safety with recognitions of cross-cultural variations in presentations and there have been increased appreciation for the need for cultural formulations in supporting consumers in their recovery. **also strongly adapted from Rachel's**

Thus, it is important to acknowledge the influence of cultural contexts upon the expression and treatment of mental disorders particularly in the multinational landscape of Australia and within previously marginalised populations. 
 
 **it's bad to force diagnoses as people**




Furthermore, diagnostic labels and "facts" can overshadow the non-biological factors of illness leading to value systems, cultural perspectives and spirituality being overlooked.  **diagnoses ignore other things**

## Recovery

Rigid commitments to diagnoses as "facts" magnifies the paternalistic nature of historical psychiatric practice and threatens the therapeutic alliance central to recovery. As this is highlighted as the core necessity to successful therapy as per RANZCP clinical guidelines for mood disorders, such commitments actively violate non-maleficent ethical principles.

Early training rotations as an inpatient registrar were overwhelmingly comprised of biological management for acute diagnoses ie. consumers with psychotic relapses were treated with antipsychotic medications. Such involuntary management, compounded by restrictive environments, are often highly traumatising and can be counter-therapeutic due to removal of consumer's existing supports. My subsequent time in community and rehabilitation roles have highlighted the negative impacts of traditional models of care towards consumers and their recovery process, with prior adverse experiences with mental health services leading to refusal to participate in long-term preventative care and subsequent re-traumatisation with involuntary approaches when they become unwell. 

Such shared-decision practice reaffirms our roles as a collaborator and advocate (CANMEDS, 2015) and focuses on the holistic management to recruit supports and enhance self-advocacy. By promoting this patient-centredness, consumers can also appreciate the concerns raised by clinicians and their community, thus developing insight, promoting empowerment and enhances the therapeutic alliance. Supervision sessions and reflection through Balint groups have provided increased understanding of the traditional paternalistic practice regarding treating mental illness and the harms of such, and to instead focus on the lived experience of consumers and to support their views towards recovery. 

## Conclusion

Utilising diagnoses as tools for communication, in collection with other trauma-informed and recovery-orientated strategies, thus facilitates increased personal and individualised care of consumers and carers to the benefit of society as a whole.
