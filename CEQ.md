Psychiatry is unique in medicine in that there remains robust debate about the nature of, and existence of, the diseases it seeks to treat. This discourse extends beyond the academic sphere, and is amplified within consumers and carers. The stimulus suggests that "diagnosis is a useful form of communication" however that "it is not a fact". 
**{ define the term “diagnosis”}
This essay will explore how {} from my personal perspective as a psychiatry trainee and more broadly within the mental health system.**

Ethical and historical

Firstly, understandings of illness have been subject to centuries of historical and sociocultural influence however continue to vary in present day, shaped by consumers' individual context and their lived experience. 

Diagnostic frameworks have existed and evolved since the Ancient Egyptian Book of Hearts as evidenced through the iterative DSM editions from psychoanalytic, to neurobiological, to reverse-nosological conceptual understandings of disease (Aftab, 2021). Diagnostic terms are thus neither fixed nor universal and the dangers of utilising diagnoses as "facts" can be observed historically in the Rosenhan experiment (1973) which relied upon then-considered objective diagnostic criteria to institutionalise and dehumanise those assessed as mentally ill. 

**Despite acknowledging the errors and harms imposed by historical practice (RANZCP position statement 84), psychiatry continues to face criticism for its over-reliance on operational criteria and over-medicalisation of ???.**

These flaws frequently appear when clinical diagnoses are employed in legal, forensic and insurance settings, where the true extent of psychological distress and functional impairment experienced by consumers are lost (RANZCP position statement 77). Diagnoses have been further exploited as political tools to control and dehumanise the population as evidenced by historical diagnosing of "sluggish schizophrenia" to suppress political dissidents within the Soviet Union.

Reduction of consumers to diagnoses strips the biopsychosocial context that 

Therefore, utilising diagnoses as facts opens up potential avenues to harm our patients essentially wtf am I writingggggggggggggggggggg.

Alternative experiences of illness also arise from different cultural contexts. Regarding diagnoses as "facts" can lead to ignorance of Non-Western cultures, for example Maori, place a greater emphasis on the family unit with respect to spiritual factors. 

Current practice guidelines and diagnostic systems are based extensively upon data collected in Western nations. By forcing marginalised groups such as the CALD, LGBT+ and ATSI populations into traditionally Western models, the power imbalance is reinforced and perpetuates the intergenerational trauma and discriminatory practices ??? (RANZCP Position Statement 105).

Finally, lack of insight or anosognosia is common in schizophrenia-spectrum illnesses, presenting barriers against shared decision making.

**subsequent disagreement between the clinician and consumer. However, pathways towards recovery can endure.**

Rigid commitments to diagnoses as "facts" magnifies the paternalistic nature of historical psychiatric practice and threatens the therapeutic alliance central to recovery.

This is highlighted as the core necessity to successful therapy as per RANZCP clinical guidelines for mood disorders.

Early training rotations as an inpatient registrar were overwhelmingly comprised of biological managements for acute diagnoses ie. consumers with psychotic relapses were treated with antipsychotic medications. Such involuntary management, compounded by restrictive environments, are often highly traumatising and can be counter-therapeutic due to removal of their existing supports. Subsequently, further time in community and rehabilitation roles have highlighted the negative impacts of traditional models of care towards consumers and their recovery process. 

Adoption of strategies from the Open Dialogue Model (Sekkila et al, 1990s) by conducting team discussions and reflections in the presence of consumers and carers, provides opportunity to promote patient centred care and limited enhancement of autonomy within the involuntary setting irrespective of diagnostic concordance. Such shared-decision practice reaffirms our roles as a collaborator and advocate (CANMEDS, 2015)
